## What is Cisco Meeting Server (CMS)?

Cisco Meeting Server is an on-premises video conferencing platform that allows businesses to host and join video meetings, regardless of their location.

## What is Cisco Meeting Management (CMM)?

Cisco Meeting Management (CMM) is a management tool for Cisco's on-premises video conferencing platform, CMS. It allows administrators to monitor and manage meetings that are running on the platform, and it also provides information about which Cisco licenses are being used.

Starting Version 3.0, installation of CMS has to be done through CMM.
