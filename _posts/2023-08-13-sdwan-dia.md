## What is Direct Internet Access?

Direct Internet Access is a networking solution that lets branch routers connect directly to the internet for improved performance and efficiency, using intelligent traffic routing and security features.

## Configuring NAT on Feature Template

First, Open the Feature Teamplate for the Interface facing the Internet, then enable NAT

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Policies

Now we configure policies to allow users on site 10 and 11 to access the Internet. <br>
Go to Configuration >> Policies, Create new Centralized Policy

<br>

Then on Data Prefix, create a prefix list containing the prefix of Site 10 and Site 11 IP

<br>

Next create Site Lists

![x](/static/2023-08-13-sdwan-dia/04.png)

<br>

Then create a TLOC lists of both sites

> TLOC (transport location) refers to a logical representation of a network site's connectivity options. It defines how a site is connected to the WAN and specifies the transport technologies and characteristics available at that site. <br> Tlocs determines how traffic is routed and optimized within the SD-WAN network.

<br>

And then create VPN list, which we'll only use the VPN 99, Click Next

<br>

Under Configure Traffic Rules >> Traffic Data, Create New Policy

![x](/static/2023-08-13-sdwan-dia/07.png)

<br>

On Sequnce Type, select Custom

![x](/static/2023-08-13-sdwan-dia/08.png)

<br>

Create a Custom Rule to allow traffic to Destination Prefix of VPN99 Users

![x](/static/2023-08-13-sdwan-dia/09.png)

<br>

Add another rule that match traffic with Source Prefix of VPN99 Users, then send it to VPN0 NAT Enabled Interface

![x](/static/2023-08-13-sdwan-dia/10.png)

<br>

And create the last rule with similar config as the last one, but with additional local TLOC

![x](/static/2023-08-13-sdwan-dia/11.png)

<br>

We end up with 3 sequence rules

![x](/static/2023-08-13-sdwan-dia/12.png)

<br>

Then go to Default Action and choose accept. Save the Data Policy

![x](/static/2023-08-13-sdwan-dia/13.png)

<br>

Last one, give the Policy a name and on Traffic Data, select the Service List and VPN List created earlier. Save the Policy

## Activating the Policy

Right now if we try to access the internet from an endpoint on the branch router, it won't have the route for that

![x](/static/2023-08-13-sdwan-dia/15.png)

<br>

So let's activate the DIA Policy

![x](/static/2023-08-13-sdwan-dia/16.png)

<br>

And now if we try simulating an access to internet, it will have a route

![x](/static/2023-08-13-sdwan-dia/17.png)

<br>

Trying it on the actual end device proves the same

<br>

If we take a look at the edge router, we can see the NAT process is working as intended

![x](/static/2023-08-13-sdwan-dia/19.png)

<br>

And inspecting the traffic on the firewall also shows that the IP going outside is the edge router's internet facing interface
