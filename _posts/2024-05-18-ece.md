## Installation on ECE Data Server

Prerequisites needed before installation is a clean Windows Server with SQL Installed

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/01.png)

<br>

Then just run the ECE installer

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/02.png)

<br>

Set to install everything except the Web Server

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/03.png)

<br>

Provide the installation path

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/04.png)

<br>

Then set some ports which we should just leave the default values

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/05.png)

> * Jetty is an open-source Java-based web server used to serve ECE App web applications. 

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/06.png)

> * ActiveMQ serves as the messaging backbone that facilitates communication between different components of the system. 
> * ActiveMQ is used to queue and manage messages, ensuring that information such as chat requests, email routing, and agent notifications are efficiently handled and delivered.

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/07.png)

> * RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is a Java API that allows objects to invoke methods on remote objects located on different JVMs (Java Virtual Machines). 
> * It facilitates communication between applications running on separate systems by enabling the execution of methods as if they were on the local machine. 

<br>

Next set the context root name, which we also leave the default

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/08.png)

<br>

Next give it the System Admin and Partiiton Admin credentials

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/09.png)

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/10.png)

<br>

Next set the installation name and a unique 4 digits identifier value

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/11.png)

<br>

After that, select the SQL Auth method

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/14.png)

<br>

Then fill up the details for the MasterDB and ActiveDB

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/15.png)

> * MasterDB serves as the primary database, storing configuration, historical, and operational data crucial for the system's functioning. It handles read-write operations and stores static information like user accounts and system settings.

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/15a.png)

> * ActiveDB manages real-time operational data such as ongoing chat sessions and email interactions. It optimizes performance by offloading live data processing from MasterDB, ensuring better responsiveness. ActiveDB synchronizes with MasterDB to maintain data consistency.

<br>

Next set the DB Path which we sould aldo leave the default values

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/16.png)

<br>

After that configure the details for the ReportsDB

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/17.png)

> *  ReportsDB serves as a dedicated repository for storing and managing reporting data. It collects, aggregates, and organizes information related to performance metrics, agent activities, and customer interactions. 

<br>

Also set the DB Path

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/18.png)

<br>

Next, set the SQL user 

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/19.png)

<br>

And the domain user

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/20.png)

<br>

And finally, review the configuration and proceed with installation

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/21.png)

<br>

After awhile, we should have the services installed on ECE Data Server

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/22.png)

<br>
<br>

## Installation on ECE Web Server

On the ECE Web Server, all that's needed is a fresh Windows Server and we can proceed to run the installer

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/24.png)

<br>

Here we point it to the ECE Data Server hostname

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/25.png)

<br>

Then provide the installation path

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/26.png)

<br>

Next select the IIS Web Site Name

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/27.png)

<br>

Then match the context root name as configured on the data server

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/28.png)

<br>

Same goes with the partition

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/29.png)

<br>

And provide the domain user

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/30.png)

<br>

Review the configuration and hit install

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/31.png)

<br>

After a minute the Web Service should be installed on ECE Web Server

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/32.png)

<br>

Here make sure the URL Rewrite is pointing to the ECE Data Server

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/33.png)

<br>

After some minutes, the ECE Web Console should be accessible

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/34.png)

<br>
<br>

## PCCE Integration

On CCE Admin, add both the Data Server and the Web Server

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/35.png)

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/36.png)

<br>

Now the ECE Widget should show up on the CCE Admin Overview

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/37.png)

<br>

Access it, and go to Integration >> Unified CCE, fill in the AW details

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/38.png)

<br>

Next RDP to AW and open Configuration Manager, set Application Path List to have a new Application Path containing these 3 members

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/39.png)

<br>

Back on CCE Admin, select the Instance "Multichannel" and select CUCM Agent Peripheral Gateway

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/40.png)

<br>

Now we can start the EAMS Service

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/41.png)

<br>

Now RDP to PG and run the Perpheral Gateway Setup, edit the PG2A

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/42.png)

<br>

Add a new PIM (Peripheral Interface Manager) pointing to ECE Data Server on default port 38001 and the Periperhal ID 5004

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/43.png)

<br>

Make sure the Periperhal ID mathces the ECE Data Server on here

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/43a.png)

<br>

Back on PG, hit next until the wizard finishes

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/44.png)

<br>

Now we can start the EAAS service on port 38001

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/45.png)

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/46.png)

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Chat

Now we'll configure so ECE can handle chats, create a new Call Type and Dialed Number with Routing Type of ECE Data Server

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/47.png)

<br>

Create an ICM Script to forward the message to a Skill Group, and bind the Script to a Call Type

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/48.png)

<br>

Next on ECE Admin, create a new Entry Point of 1001 pointing to the newly created script

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/49.png)

<br>

And now if we login as an agent and hit the Entry Point as the customer, we have a livechats!

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/50.png)

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Email

To configure email, add a new alias containing the email details

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/51.png)

<br>

Next create a new Workflow to forward the email from the newly created alias to a queue

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/52.png)

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/52a.png)

<br>

Then create a new ICM Script to forward the emails to a Skill Group

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/52b.png)

<br>

And now lets try sending email to the registered alias

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/53.png)

<br>

ECE will retrieve those emails and assign in to an available agent, here agent can interact with the email like replying to it

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/54.png)

<br>

And we can see the reply has gone through to the original email sender

![x](/static/2024-05-18-ece/55.png)
