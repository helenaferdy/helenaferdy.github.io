## What is UCS Manager?

UCS Manager provides a centralized interface for configuring, monitoring, and managing all components within the UCS infrastructure. This includes servers, network connectivity, storage access, and virtualization resources. It simplifies the management of data center resources, streamlines provisioning, and offers features for automation and orchestration of tasks.

## What is Fabric Interconnect

A Fabric Interconnect, often abbreviated as FI, is a key component in Cisco's Unified Computing System (UCS) architecture, designed for data center environments. The Fabric Interconnect is a networking device that plays a central role in connecting and managing all the components within a UCS setup, including servers, storage, and networking equipment. It acts as an intermediary between the servers and the external network.

## Creating Service Template

First, access the UCS Manager

<br>

Give it a name, a sequence number, and number of instances. Here we'll service templates for 8 esxi servers.
Select the base template that will be used, which in this case will be VMware ESXi 6.5

## Changing Storage RAID Configuration

By default, these templates use RAID 1 Mirrored configuration, which is good for redundancy but we want to utilize all the available storage so we will change it to RAID 0 Striped. <br>
Click on the newly created template then select Change Local Disk Configuration Policy

Select Create Local Disk Configuration Policy, give it a name and change the mode to RAID 0 Striped

<br>

After a while, Overall status should change to OK
