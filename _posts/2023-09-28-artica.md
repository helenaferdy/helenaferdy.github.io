Artica Proxy is an open-source proxy server and web filtering appliance used for various network-related tasks, including content filtering, caching, and security. Artica acts as an intermediary between web servers and clients, caching frequently requested content to improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage.

## Connection Topology

Here's the connection topology, where all the HTTP/HTTPS traffic from client will go through the proxy server first before going to the firewall then the internet

## Configuring Artica Proxy

Now the proxy should be up and running

![x](/static/2023-09-28-artica/07.png)

<br>

Configure the interface so it sits behind the firewall in the inside segment

![x](/static/2023-09-28-artica/08a.png)

<br>

Check the proxy status, make sure it is running

![x](/static/2023-09-28-artica/08.png)

<br>

And configure the listening port, the default is 3128

<br>

Now accessing the internet using this proxy is working

<br>

On Realtime Requests, we can see the traffic indeed going through the proxy server

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Firewall

Now we configure the firewall to only allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic coming from the proxy server and deny the rest. This will force the client to only able access the internet if using proxy.

<br>

## Client Access

On the client side, configure the proxy

![x](/static/2023-09-28-artica/12.png)

<br>

Now the internet is accessible only if proxy is configured

![x](/static/2023-09-28-artica/16.png)

> chrome (left) doesnt have proxy configured, while firefox (right) does

<br>

On the firewall it shows all the web traffic is blocked except the ones coming from the proxy server

![x](/static/2023-09-28-artica/17.png)

<br>

And the proxied traffic can also be monitored on artica

<br>

## Website Blocking

On Artica, we can also set to block access to certains websites, on Your Proxy >> web-site blocking, add the entry

![x](/static/2023-09-28-artica/18.png)

<br>

And now if the blocked site is accessed, it'll throw an error "access denied"
