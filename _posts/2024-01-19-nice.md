## Preparing the Installation Environments

Here's the overall topology for this installation

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/00.png)

<br>

First we're gonna do most of our works on the NICE Unified server "nc". <br> 
Here the SQL Server 2019 has been installed

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/01.png)

<br>
<br>

## Running the SRT (Site Readiness Tool)

Run the SRT on NICE Unified, fill in the necessary data

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/02.png)

<br>

Next select the Capacity_Planner.xml and select Single Data Hub installation.<br>
For the Application Package, Select Ineraction Package with the Deployment Options of Unified Deployment

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/03.png)

<br>

After that complete the Connectivity Tests on both servers

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/04.png)

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/05.png)

<br>

On the Site Map, we can see the summary of packacges being installed on both servers

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/06.png)

<br>

Next is for the Disk Allocations, make sure all servers have the required disks as shown here

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/07.png)

<br>

Then enter the credentials for the installation

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/08.png)

<br>

For recording integrations, we'll intergrate it with Cisco CUCM only

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/09.png)

<br>

Then run the SRT Tests, make sure everything is green or at least yellow

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/10.png)

<br>

After all's done, we'll get the SRT Report. Export it for later use on NDM

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/11.png)

<br>
<br>

## Running NDM (NICE Deployment Manager)

First run the NiceTechCreator.bat to create all the neccessary directories for the installation

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/12.png)

<br>

Put the NDM folder on "NDMFiles" directory

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/13.png)

<br>

The inside the NDM folder, put all the packages needed on the "Packages" folder

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/14.png)

<br>

Also put all the Service Packs on the "Service Packs" folder

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/15.png)

<br>

Launch the NDM and import the SRT file

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/16.png)

<br>

Fill in the necessary details

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/17.png)

<br>

Double check everything, for this we just leave mostly as it is for both servers

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/18.png)

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/19.png)

<br>

After that wait for the validation to finish, then select start

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/20.png)

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/21.png)

<br>

Then we just wait for the NDM to finish installing all the services and packages to both servers. This will take several hours

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/22.png)

<br>

After couple hours, the installation finishes

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/23.png)

<br>

We also get a neat NDM Report for the details of the installation

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/24.png)

<br>
<br>

## Configuring NICE

Now the NICE Portal should be accessible from the web browser pointing to the NICE Unified server. The default login is nice/nice

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/25.png)

<br>

Next import the license

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/26.png)

<br>

<br>

Select all the users to be recorded on this source pool

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/44.png)

<br>

Then create a recording profile with the source pool and recorder pool created just now

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/45.png)

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/46.png)

<br>

And lastly define the recording profile details

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/47.png)

<br>

### Storage Groups

Create a new storage group pointing to the prepared directory for the archived recording media

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/48.png)

<br>

### Archiving Rules

Create a new rule for archiving pointing to the storage group created just now

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/49.png)

<br>


### SIP Trunk to CUCM

Create a SIP Trunk connection from CUCM to NICE Unified Server

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/51.png)

<br>

### JTAPI Integration

Next set the java path by running this command on the NICE Unified Server

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/53.png)

<br>

Then download the JTAPI Client from CUCM

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/52.png)

<br>

After that run the installer

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/54.png)

<br>

On Environment Variables, make sure the JTAPI path has been created

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/55.png)

<br>

Next go to JTAPI64Tools directory and run the jtprefs.bat, configure the CUCM IP Address

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/58.png)

<br>
<br>

## Testing Call Recording

Now if we make a call on the registered device, we should see its RTP being traced on the NICE AIR server for recording purposes

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/59.png)

<br>

And on NICE Business Analyzer, we can see the call is recorded

![x](/static/2024-01-19-nice/60.png)
