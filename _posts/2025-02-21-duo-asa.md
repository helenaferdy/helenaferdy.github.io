Cisco Duo integrates with ASA's AnyConnect VPN to provide MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for secure remote access. When a user logs in to the AnyConnect VPN client, Duo's authentication process is triggered, typically after the primary credentials are validated against an Active Directory. Duo pushes a second factor, such as a mobile app notification, SMS, or phone call, to the user for verification to add an additional layer of security for VPN access.

## Creating User

Then we create a User, this user has to be present on the Local Active Directory

Here's the user with the same name on the AD side

## ASA Configuration

On ASA, we'll add the Duo Proxy Server as an AAA Radius Server

<br>

After that, we can run the authentiction test using the "senafrd" user, we should receive MFA confirmation on our Duo Mobile App

<br>

Now we can select the Duo as the AAA Server Group on the VPN Connection Profiles

<br>

And when we try connecting to VPN, we'll get the MFA confirmation on the App
