A Private VLAN (PVLAN) is an extension of a regular VLAN that enhances security by restricting communication between devices within the same VLAN. It has three types of ports: Promiscuous (can communicate with all), Isolated (can only talk to promiscuous ports), and Community (can talk to each other and promiscuous ports but not isolated ports).

## PVLAN Configurations

Here's the overall configuration for the PVLAN, where all PVLAN configuration will be taking place on the Access Switch, whereas the Core only acts as a DHCP Server and VLAN Default Gateway

```text
#Core

ip dhcp pool VLAN10
 network 10.10.0.0 /24
 default-router 10.20.0.1

interface vlan 10
 ip address 10.10.0.1 255.255.255.0

interface Gig0/0
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
```

<br>

On SW-1, we enable the PVLAN on VLAN 10, where it'll have a secondary vlans of VLAN 101, 102, and 103.

```text
vtp mode off

vlan 10
 private-vlan primary
 private-vlan association 101,102,103

vlan 101
 private-vlan isolated

vlan 102
 private-vlan community

vlan 103
 private-vlan community

```

<br>

Then we associate the PVLAN to their respective interfaces

```text
interface gi0/0
 switchport mode private-vlan mapping 10 101,102,103

interface range gi1/0-1
 switchport mode private-vlan host
 switchport private-vlan host-association 10 101

interface range gi1/2-3
 switchport mode private-vlan host
 switchport private-vlan host-association 10 102

interface range gi0/1-2
 switchport mode private-vlan host
 switchport private-vlan host-association 10 103
```

<br>

Run "show vlan private-vlan" to verify the configuration

<br>

And run "show interface switchport" to verify interface configurations

<br>

Running "show mac address-table" or "show interface status" also confirms the PVLAN configurations

## PVLAN Testing

On PC-1 and PC-2 running on Isolated Ports, we can only access the Promiscuous Port and nothing else

<br>

On PC-3 and PC-5 running on their respective Community Ports, they can access to PCs on the same Community and to Promiscuous Port
