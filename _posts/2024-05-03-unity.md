## CUCM Configuration for Unity

On CUCM, create SIP Trunk Security Profile with some Accept options being checked

<br>

Next create a route pattern that points to a SIP Trunk going to Unity Connection

<br>

Next on Advanced >> Voice Mail Pilot, add the Pilot Number

<br>

Then on Voice Mail Profile, select the Pilot and make this default

That should do it on CUCM side.

<br>
<br>

## Unity Configuration

On Cisco Unity, go to Telephony Integrations >> Phone System, create new one and save it

<br>

Back on Unity Phone System, go to CUCM AXL Servers

<br>

Enter the CUCM IP Address and AXL user

<br>

Next enter the SIP and TFTP Servers

<br>

At this point if we make a call to 9000, we should be connected to Unity

<br>

Lastly to give personalized voice mail inboxes, import the CUCM user

<br>

Next we'll be able to use the Voice Mail feature
