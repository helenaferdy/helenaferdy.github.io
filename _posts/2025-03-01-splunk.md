Cisco Splunk Enterprise is a data analytics platform that collects, analyzes, and visualizes machine data, including logs from various network devices. It works with **syslog** by ingesting log data from routers, switches, firewalls, and other products, helping with security monitoring, network performance analysis, and troubleshooting.

To display data in **Splunk**, we can install various apps (like Cisco Security Suite or Cisco eStreamer for Firepower) from **Splunkbase**. These apps provide **dashboards, reports, and alerts**, making it easier to analyze syslog data, detect anomalies, and gain insights into network health and security.


## Installing Splunk

First download the Splunk Enterprise installer, in this case we're choosing the .rpm linux installer because we're installing it on RHEL

<br>

On the RHEL machine, run "dnf install" to install the package

![x](/static/2025-03-01-splunk/02.png)

<br>

After it finishes, the installation path can be found on /opt/splunk, start the service by invoking "./opt/splunk/bin/splunk start"

<br>

Create credentials to access the GUI later on

<br>

That should do it, now Splunk is up port 8000. Dont forget to open the RHEL firewall to allow connections to the said port

![x](/static/2025-03-01-splunk/05.png)

```
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8000/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
```

<br>

Make sure the ports for Web GUI and for syslog are open

![x](/static/2025-03-01-splunk/05a.png)

```
firewall-cmd --list-ports
```

<br>

The GUI should be accessibl on port 8000

## Adding Apps

To ingest syslog from ASA devices, we need to install the Add-on and the App

![x](/static/2025-03-01-splunk/08.png)

<br>

## Adding Data Inputs

On Settings >> Data Inputs, select Add New on UDP

![x](/static/2025-03-01-splunk/09.png)

<br>

Configure the UDP Syslog receiver to receive data from the ASA device

<br>

Set Source type to cisco:asa

![x](/static/2025-03-01-splunk/11.png)

<br>

Review and submit

## Sending Syslog

On the ASA Device, configure it to send syslog messages to Splunk

<br>

## Processing the Data in Splunk

On Search, we can see the logs from ASA starts coming in to Splunk

![x](/static/2025-03-01-splunk/14.png)

<br>

On the App, we can now create a Dashboard using this syslog data

![x](/static/2025-03-01-splunk/15.png)

<br>

For example here, if we want to watch closely syslog about vpn users connecting

![x](/static/2025-03-01-splunk/16.png)

<br>

Or to watch connection traffic by seeing its ACL logs

<br>

We can also use other pre-build apps available to download from Splunkbase
