F5 Global Traffic Manager (GTM) is a DNS-based load balancing solution that provides global server load balancing and traffic management across multiple data centers or multiple nodes to improve application availability and performance.

<br>

Here's the current topology of my lab

![01](/static/2023-08-01-f5-gtm/01.png)

<br>

F1 and F2 are linux servers serving web on port 80 (http)

![02](/static/2023-08-01-f5-gtm/02.png)

<br>

The plan is to load balance the web request coming to these 2 servers using GTM (Global Traffic Manager) with DNS GSLB (Global Server Load Balancing). Let's start!

<br>
<br>

## Create DNS Listener on F5

<br>

The domain that i have on my lab is helena.gg, and here on F5 i will set it as a nameserver to handle all the DNS query requests for the delegated subdomain of lab.helena.gg 

<br>

To set it up, go to DNS >> Delivery >> Listener, and create new

Give it a name and an IP Address 


<br>
<br>

## Create Datacenter

<br>

Next creata a Datacenter, because my topology only spans inside one datacenter, i'll only create one. <br>
To create, Go to GSLB >> Data Centers >> Data Center List

<br>
<br>

## Create Server List

<br>

After that let's create the server list, go to DNS >> GSLB >> Server Lists.

The first server list is named GTM, this list will contain all the IP Address of GTM's external and internal interfaces

<br>

The second one is the list server containing the linux servers where the webs are hosted

![06](/static/2023-08-01-f5-gtm/06.png)

<br>

And this is the server lists that i end up with

<br>
<br>

## Create Server Pool

<br>

Next let's create the server pool containing the linux web servers. <br>
Go to GSLB >> Pools >> Pool Lists

![08](/static/2023-08-01-f5-gtm/08.png)

<br>
<br>

## Create Wide IP List

<br>

Lastly, create the Wide IP FQDN that will be hit by the DNS Server containing the pool that has just been created


![09](/static/2023-08-01-f5-gtm/09.png)

<br>

And this everything should light green indicating the web servers are reachable.

<br>

That's pretty much it for the configuration on the F5 side, now proceed to the DNS Server, which in my case is on my Active Directory Domain Controller 

<br>
<br>


## Delegate the Subdomain on DNS Server

<br>

On the DNS Manager, create a new Name Server Rntry that points to the F5 DNS Listener

![11](/static/2023-08-01-f5-gtm/11.png)

<br>

Then create a delegation subdomain, which will be subdomain lab

![12](/static/2023-08-01-f5-gtm/12.png)

![13](/static/2023-08-01-f5-gtm/13.png)

<br>

Then add the newly created nameserver entry as this subdomain's name server

![14](/static/2023-08-01-f5-gtm/14.png)

<br>

Lastly, create a CNAME record that points to FQDN subdomain that exist on F5 Wide IP configuration

![15](/static/2023-08-01-f5-gtm/15.png)

<br>

And that's pretty much it. Let's test it

<br>
<br>


## Test the GTM

<br>

Pinging the f.helena.gg will give an alternating resolved IP between F1 and F2 servers, because the load balancing algorithm is set to round robin.

<br>

Same goes if it's being hit on the port 80 using web server
