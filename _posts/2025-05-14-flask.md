Gunicorn is used for production Flask deployments because it's a robust, pre-fork worker model WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) server that efficiently handles multiple requests concurrently. Unlike Flaskâ€™s built-in development server, Gunicorn is designed for performance, scalability, and reliability in real-world, multi-user environments.

<br>

## Gunicorn

Here we have a simple Flask app that runs on development mode

<br>

Before we start running it with Gunicorn, lets contain this app inside a virtual environment called flaskenv

```
python3 -m venv ~/env/flaskenv
source  ~/env/flaskenv/bin/activate
```

<br>

Next we install Flask and Gunicorn inside the venv

<br>

Then create a new file named "wsgi.py"

```python
from main import app

if __name__ == '__main__':
 app.run()
```

<br>

Now we can run the gunicorn on port 5000, spawning 4 workers and calling the wsgi.py file

```
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --workers 4 wsgi:app
```

<br>

And the flask app is up and running using gunicorn

## Running as Service

Now we want to run Gunicorm/Flask as a service, create a new service file on /etc/systemd/system/flask.service

```
[Unit]
Description=Gunicorn for flaskapp
After=network.target

[Service]
User=helena
Group=helena
WorkingDirectory=/home/helena/flask
Environment="PATH=/home/helena/env/flaskenv/bin"
ExecStart=/home/helena/env/flaskenv/bin/gunicorn --reload --workers 4 --threads 8 --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 wsgi:app
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

![x](/static/2025-05-14-flask/09.png)

<br>

Then we can start the service

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start flask
sudo systemctl enable flask
```

## Nginx Reverse Proxy

Lastly we add an Nginx Reverse Proxy to serve traffic from clients, follow this [NGINX post](https://helenaferdy.github.io/posts/nginx/) for detailed steps. <br>
Here we create a new reverse-proxy file on sites-available directory

![x](/static/2025-05-14-flask/11.png)

<br>

Then activate the file by creating a symlink in sites-enabled directory

![x](/static/2025-05-14-flask/12.png)

<br>

After reloading nginx, we should now serve the flask app on port 80 through nginx
