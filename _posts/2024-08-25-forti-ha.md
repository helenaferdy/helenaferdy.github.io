A Fortigate HA (High Availability) Cluster is a configuration that links multiple Fortigate firewalls to work together as a single unit, providing redundancy and load balancing. This setup ensures continuous network availability by automatically transferring control to a standby unit if the active device fails, minimizing downtime and maintaining service continuity.

## Active-Passive

First configure all the interfaces on the Primary Node, here we dont use IP Address on the Heartbeat beacuse it will be linked through layer 2

<br>

Next on System >> HA, change mode to Active-Passive and configure the Cluster Settings

> Use Unicast Heartbeat to use Layer 3 for the Heatbeat Link

<br>

On the Secondary node, all we need is the management interface

<br>

Then configure the same Cluster Settings

<br>

Now the HA Cluster has been established

## Failing Over

On the Primary Node, we'll disable the uplink and downlink interfaces to simulate a network failure

<br>

Now if we access the management interface, it'll automatically opens the Secondary Node, and it also shows that the Seconary Node has become the active node

<br>

On the Endpoint side, no drops on the network to be seen while the failover is happening

<br>

If we restore the network functionality on the Primary Node, it'll not take the Active role, instead it'll stay as a standby node

<br>

To force a failover back to Primary Node, run "execute ha failover status 1" or simply simulate a network failure on Secondary Node

<br>

And now the Active node is back on the Primary

## Active-Active

To configure the HA Cluster to be Active-Active, repeat the process but simply change the HA mode on both sides

<br>

And now it is on as Active-Active
