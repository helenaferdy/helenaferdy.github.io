F5 BIG-IP provides features such as load balancing, application security, SSL offloading, and application acceleration to ensure the availability, security, and performance of applications in data centers and the cloud. <br>

F5 is a paid appliance, so to install it on lab, we need to request for a trial key.

<br>
<br>

## Requesting Trial Key

<br>

Go to [F5 Website](https://my.f5.com/), register for an account, and request a trial for BIG-IP VE (Virtual Edition)

After spinning the VM up, it'll automatically get an IP through DHCP

## Configuring BIG-IP F5

<br>

First, set the management IP address, make sure it is on different segment with other interfaces.

<br>

Next configure the internal facing interface, give it an untagged vlan if you dont plan to play around with vlan.

<br>

Then configure the external facing interface, pretty much the same configguration as the previous one.
