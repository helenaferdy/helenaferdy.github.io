Grok Exporter is a standalone module what we can use to parse syslog messages and pass it to a monitoring tool like Prometheus.

<br>

## Prerequisite

If you want to run this module with dummy data, create a new log file with these syslog messages

```shell
sudo mkdir /opt/python-syslog/
sudo nano /opt/python-syslog/output-syslog.log
```

```

Otherwise, if you want to use real syslog data by creating your own syslog server, check out this post on how to [Create Syslog Server with Python](https://helenaferdy.github.io/posts/python-syslog/)

## Setting up Grok Exporter

First, download the [Grok Exporter](https://github.com/fstab/grok_exporter/releases/download/v1.0.0.RC5/grok_exporter-1.0.0.RC5.linux-amd64.zip) file and unzip it.

```shell
wget https://github.com/fstab/grok_exporter/releases/download/v1.0.0.RC5/grok_exporter-1.0.0.RC5.linux-amd64.zip
unzip grok_exporter-1.0.0.RC5.linux-amd64.zip
```

<br>

Then copy the files to the installation directory

```shell
cd grok_exporter-1.0.0.RC5.linux-amd64
sudo cp -r grok_exporter patterns/ /usr/local/bin/
```

<br>

Next create a configuration file

```shell
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/grok.yml
```

Paste in this config

```yml
global:
  config_version: 3
input:
  type: file
  path: /opt/python-syslog/output-syslog.log
  readall: true
imports:
- type: grok_patterns
  dir: ./patterns
grok_patterns:
- 'CISCOTIMESTAMPTZ %{MONTH} +%{MONTHDAY}(?: %{YEAR})? %{TIME}(?: %{TZ})?'
metrics:
- type: counter
  name: cisco_log_xxz
  help: For cisco network device syslog messages. 
  match: '%{CISCOTIMESTAMPTZ:cisco_timestamp}: %%{DATA:facility}-%{POSINT:severity:int}-%{DATA:mnemonic}: %{GREEDYDATA:log_message}: %{IP:target_ip}'
  labels:
    timestamp: '{{.cisco_timestamp}}'
    facility: '{{.facility}}'
    severity: '{{.severity}}'
    mnemonic: '{{.mnemonic}}'
    log_message: '{{.log_message}}'
    target_ip: '{{.target_ip}}'
server:
  protocol: http
  port: 9144
```

> A brief explanation for this config : <br><br>
> path: is where your syslog file located <br>
> imports: are where all the predefined grok patterns located <br>
> grok_patterns: are additional patterns that's not available inside the imported above <br>
> name: is the name that you will use to find these metrics inside prometheus later <br>
> match: is the expression matched to collect and map each metric into their own labels <br>

<br>
Here's the capture of the config file because for some reason some strings are not being rendered.

<br>

After that create the service file

```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/grok-exporter.service
```

Paste in these lines

```
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus grok_exporter server

[Service]
Restart=always
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/bin
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/grok_exporter --config=/usr/local/bin/grok.yml
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
TimeoutStopSec=20s
SendSIGKILL=no

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

<br>

Now start the service

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start grok-exporter
sudo systemctl enable grok-exporter
```

<br>

Check the service status

```shell
systemctl status grok-exporter
```

```
● grok-exporter.service - Prometheus grok_exporter server
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/grok-exporter.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)

             └─8790 /usr/local/bin/grok_exporter --config=/usr/local/bin/grok.yml

```

<br>

We can also access the metrics on http://198.18.0.201:9144/metrics, where you can see the grok exporter has successfully collected and parsed the syslogs messages

<br>

## Adding Grok Exporter to Prometheus

Access the prometheus server (if it's on different server), and open the config file.

```shell
sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

<br>

And add this on the very bottom of the config file

```yml
  - job_name: 'grok_exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9144']
```
> target is where the grok exporter installed

<br>

Run this command to make sure the config is all good

```shell
promtool check config /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

```
Checking /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
  SUCCESS: 1 rule files found
 SUCCESS: /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml is valid prometheus config file syntax

Checking /etc/prometheus/alert_server_down.yml
  SUCCESS: 1 rules found
```


<br>

And if it's all good, restart the Prometheus service.

```shell
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
```

<br>

Now if you go to prometheus graph page, you will find these metrics under the name "cisco_logx"
