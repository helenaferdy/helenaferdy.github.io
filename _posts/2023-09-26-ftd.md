<br>

Now Cisco Firewall Threat Defense is up and running

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Interfaces

On Interface, edit and configure the inside interface

![x](/static/2023-09-26-ftd/06b.png)

<br>

This is the interface configuration for now

![x](/static/2023-09-26-ftd/07a.png)

<br>

Deploy the config

![x](/static/2023-09-26-ftd/07b.png)

<br>

Now if we try accessing both the Outside or Inside Interface from their respective network, they should all be accessible

<br>
<br>

## Configuring NAT for Internet Access

On Policies >> NAT, add new to allow dynamic translation from inside network to the outside interface

![x](/static/2023-09-26-ftd/09.png)

<br>

Then on Policies >> Access Rules, add new rule to allow traffic from the inside to outside zone

![x](/static/2023-09-26-ftd/10.png)

<br>

Now on client's PC on the inside network, we should have an internet connection

![x](/static/2023-09-26-ftd/11.png)

<br>

On Monitoring >> Events, we can see the traffic from inside host to the internet

![x](/static/2023-09-26-ftd/12c.png)

<br>

Clicking on the events show more details regarding the traffic

![x](/static/2023-09-26-ftd/12d.png)

<br>

We can also see other monitoring stats which is pretty neat and handy

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Static Destination NAT

Now we're setting up a destination NAT so the inside host can be accessed using the outside public IP Address

![x](/static/2023-09-26-ftd/00a.png)

<br>

On Policies >> NAT, add a new Static NAT coming from outside to inside with the specified destination IP address

![x](/static/2023-09-26-ftd/13.png)

<br>

Then on Policies >> Access Rules, add new rule to allow traffic from the outside to inside zone

![x](/static/2023-09-26-ftd/14.png)

<br>

Now if we try accessing the public IP, we should be connected to the inside host

![x](/static/2023-09-26-ftd/15.png)

<br>

And on Monitoring >> Events, we can also see the translated traffic coming from outside here
