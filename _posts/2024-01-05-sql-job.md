A SQL Job is a scheduled task or process in Microsoft SQL Server that automates the execution of one or more SQL Server Agent jobs.

<br>

A Stored Procedure is a precompiled and stored collection of one or more SQL statements or queries. It can be called with a single command, providing a way to encapsulate and reuse code in a database.

<br>
<br>

In this scenario, we aim to periodically move data that is 2 months or older from main table to the backup table. We'll store the SQL Query used for this task in a Stored Procedure and then execute it automatically everyday with an SQL Job.

## Creating Stored Procedures

First, we create a stored procedure to copy the data older than 2 month to the backup table

<br>

Then the second stored procedure to delete the already copied data from the main table

## Creating SQL Jobs

Now we create a Job to execute 2 procedures created above, we name the Job **Daily_Backup_Conv**

<br>

Then on first step, execute the first Stored Procedure

<br>

Then the second step to execute the second Stored Procedure

<br>

Here's how the steps ended up

<br>

On schedule, select Daily Recurring at the desired time

<br>

To finsih things up, i like to log the operation onto Event Viewer everytime the job executes

## Executing SQL Jobs

To immediately start the Job, right click on it and select Start Job

<br>

Then start from the first step

![x](/static/2024-01-05-sql-job/11.png)

<br>

And looks like its a success

![x](/static/2024-01-05-sql-job/12.png)

<br>

Right click on the Job and select History, we can see the execution history

![x](/static/2024-01-05-sql-job/13.png)

<br>

We can also see the history on the Event Viewer

![x](/static/2024-01-05-sql-job/14a.png)

<br>

And checking on the tables, we can see the data has been successfully moved from the main table to the backup one
