Cisco Firewall Management Center (FMC) is a centralized management solution for larger, complex deployments of Cisco's Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW), offering advanced threat protection, comprehensive reporting, and detailed policy management across multiple devices. In contrast, Cisco Firewall Device Manager (FDM) is a local management tool for individual Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) devices, suited for smaller deployments with basic configuration needs and simpler environments. 

FMC is ideal for enterprises requiring extensive control and reporting, while FDM is best for small businesses or branch offices managing a single device.
