## What is TrueNAS?

TrueNAS is an open-source network-attached storage (NAS) solution that provides a platform for managing and sharing data across a network. 

<br>
<br>

## Preparing the Installer

Download the [TrueNAS Core](https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-core/) installer and deploy it on vCenter

<br>

After some time, the installation should conclude, reboot the server.

Now the Web UI should be up and accessible

## Creating NFS Share

First, lets create a storage pool, go to Storage >> Pool >> Add >> Create new pool

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/09.png)

Give it name and select the disk that's gonna be used, and check the force option. <br>
There will be warning saying stripe data is discouraged, which is fine because we only have 1 disk and we cant really afford to have a mirrored disk configuration

<br>

Next we create a NFS share, go to Sharing >> Unix Shares (NFS) >> Add

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/11.png)

<br>

On Services, make sure NFS is enabled

And that should be it.

<br>

Now we try attaching the NFS Share to vCenter

<br>

And it looks all good

<br>

## Creating SMB Share

To attach the storage to Windws OS, we will be using SMB. <br>
First, create a user to access the shared pool, go to Accounts >> Users >> Add

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/10.png)

Give it username, password, and permission to access the storage

<br>

Next we create the SMB share, go to Sharing >> Windows Share (SMB) >> Add

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/15.png)

<br>

Make sure SMB Service is up

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/16.png)

<br>

And that should do, lets test it by accessing it from a windows machine

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/17.png)

<br>

Provide the user created earlier

<br>

And we're golden.
