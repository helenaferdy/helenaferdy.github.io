## What is TrueNAS?

TrueNAS is an open-source network-attached storage (NAS) solution that provides a platform for managing and sharing data across a network.  <br>

> NFS (Network File System), SMB (Server Message Block), and iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface) are three different network protocols used for sharing and accessing files and storage resources in computer networks. <br>
> * NFS is used for sharing files primarily in Unix environments. <br>
> * SMB is Windows' file sharing protocol but is also used in mixed environments. <br>
> * iSCSI is for connecting storage devices to servers as block-level storage, often used in virtualization and SANs. <br>

## Preparing the Installer

Download the [TrueNAS Core](https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-core/) installer and deploy it on vCenter

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/01.png)

<br>
<br>

## Running the Installer

On setup, select Install/Upgrade

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/02.png)

<br>

Select the disk for installation

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/03.png)

<br>

Select BIOS, honestly wen can select either but lets just go with BIOS

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/04.png)

<br>

After some time, the installation should conclude, reboot the server.

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/05.png)

<br>

Now the Web UI should be up and accessible

<br>
<br>

## Accessing TrueNAS Web UI

Access the IP on web browser

<br>

## Creating NFS Share

First, lets create a storage pool, go to Storage >> Pool >> Add >> Create new pool

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/09.png)

Give it name and select the disk that's gonna be used, and check the force option. <br>
There will be warning saying stripe data is discouraged, which is fine because we only have 1 disk and we cant really afford to have a mirrored disk configuration

<br>

Then on the created share, choose Add Dataset

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/20.png)

<br>

Give it a name and leave the rest as default, click submit

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/21.png)

<br>

This is what we end up with

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/22.png)

<br>

Next we create a NFS share, go to Sharing >> Unix Shares (NFS) >> Add

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/11.png)

<br>


On Services, make sure NFS is enabled

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/12.png)

And that should be it.

<br>

Now we try attaching the NFS Share to vCenter

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/13.png)

<br>

And it looks all good

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/14.png)

<br>
<br>

## Creating SMB Share

To attach the storage to Windws OS, we will be using SMB. <br>
First, create a user to access the shared pool, go to Accounts >> Users >> Add

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/10.png)

Give it username, password, and permission to access the storage

<br>

Next we create the SMB share, go to Sharing >> Windows Share (SMB) >> Add

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/15.png)

Here we use the same pool as the one on NFS because we want the files to be interchangeable across two different shares

<br>

Make sure SMB Service is up

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/16.png)

<br>

And that should do, lets test it by accessing it from a windows machine

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/17.png)

<br>

Provide the user created earlier

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/18.png)

<br>

And we're golden.

<br>
<br>

## Creating iSCSI Share

Here we'll use the TenGig pool, select add Zvol

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/23.png)

> "zvol" stands for "ZFS volume," and it's essentially a block device or virtual disk created within a ZFS storage pool

<br>

Configure it as below

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/24.png)

> The "block size" in computer storage and file systems is the size of the smallest unit of data that can be stored or read from a storage device. Smaller is more efficient and larger has better performance especially for larger disk size

<br>

This is what we end up with

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/25.png)

<br>

Next we create the iSCSI share, go to Sharing >> Block Shares (iSCSI) >> Wizard. <br>
Give it a name and point it to the zvol device just created

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/26.png)

<br>

We'll create a new portal with CHAP authentication

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/27.png)

> CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol) is a security protocol used in iSCSI to establish a secure authentication mechanism between the initiator (the client) and the target (the storage device)

<br>

For initator, we'll leave it empty so any machine can connect

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/28.png)

<br>

Review, and submit

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/29.png)

<br>

We end up with having this one iSCSI portal

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/30.png)

<br>

Make sure the iSCSI service is up and running

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/31.png)

<br>

Now we try to initiate the connection from the windows machine. <br>
Open iSCSI Initiator >> Discovery >> Discover Portal, enter the IP of TrueNAS

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/32.png)

<br>

The select advanced, enter the CHAP auth credetials

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/33.png)

<br>

Then on Targets, we'll see our TrueNAS share. Click connect

![x](/static/2023-09-15-truenas/34.png)

<br>

Now it's connected. We can use the disk as if it was a locally attached disk
