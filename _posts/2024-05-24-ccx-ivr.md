CCX scripting is the process of creating and managing scripts that define how incoming customer interactions are handled within the contact center. These scripts are essential for automating call flows, ensuring efficient routing, and providing a consistent customer experience. UCCX scripting uses a visual scripting tool called the "UCCX Script Editor," which allows administrators to design, test, and deploy scripts without needing extensive programming knowledge.

## Preparing CCX Script Editor

On CCX >> Tools >> Plugins, download the CCX Editor Installer

<br>

Then just connect with CCX credentials

## Call Flow

Here's the call flow that we're creating

<br>
<br>

## Creating Script

First after creating a new script, add a Play Prompt as the first audio interaction pointing to welcome.wav

<br>

Next we create a new variable to hold the value of today's date

![x](/static/2024-05-24-ccx-ivr/05.png)

<br>

Then add a new IF logic to compare the current date to the predefined holiday dates

![x](/static/2024-05-24-ccx-ivr/06.png)

<br>

Next, add a Day of Week element to determine if the date is on work days or weekends

![x](/static/2024-05-24-ccx-ivr/07.png)

<br>

Then to determine if its on or off the work hours, add the Time of Day element

![x](/static/2024-05-24-ccx-ivr/08.png)

<br>

After that, add a Menu to allow options to press one or two

![x](/static/2024-05-24-ccx-ivr/09.png)

<br>

On the press of no 1, direct it to the Resource that points to a CSQ 

![x](/static/2024-05-24-ccx-ivr/10.png)

<br>

Then add a Queue loop for when there's no agents available so the caller can wait with a music played

![x](/static/2024-05-24-ccx-ivr/11.png)

<br>

Next on the press of no 2, we add a Call Redirect that points to the Reception Variable

![x](/static/2024-05-24-ccx-ivr/12.png)

<br>

Here's the final script for this call flow

<br>
<br>

## Uploading Scripts

On CCX >> Application >> Script Management, upload the script

![x](/static/2024-05-24-ccx-ivr/13.png)

<br>

Next upload all the audio prompts on  Application >> Prompt Management

![x](/static/2024-05-24-ccx-ivr/14.png)

<br>

Finally, select the script on the application

![x](/static/2024-05-24-ccx-ivr/15.png)

At this point the IVR is done ready to handle calls

<br>
<br>

## Call Variables

Additionally, if we want to utilize some call data and display it on the Finesse as a call variable, we can add a Get Contact Info element and store these data on some variables

![x](/static/2024-05-24-ccx-ivr/16.png)

<br>

Nex to actually show it on Finesse, add Set Enterprise Call Info element and map the variable into the desired Call Variable

![x](/static/2024-05-24-ccx-ivr/17.png)

<br>

Now these data are shown on Finesse
