## Configuring Interfaces

First, lets configure the outside interface

```shell
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 nameif outside
 security-level 0
 ip address 198.100.0.2 255.255.255.0 
```

<br>

Next the inside

```shell
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 nameif inside
 security-level 100
 ip address 63.0.0.1 255.255.255.0 
```

<br>

Add a static route on the outside to the internet

```shell
route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 198.100.0.1 1
```

<br>

That should do, this configuration can also be viewed on ASDM

And pinging the interfaces from inside and outside network shows these are up and running
