Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) is a security device developed by Cisco Systems that provides firewall, VPN (Virtual Private Network), and other network security features.

## Network Topology

Here's this deployment's network topology

<br>
<br>

## Preparing the Installer

Download the installer from [Cisco Download Central](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286119613/type)

![x](/static/2023-09-24-asa/00b.png)

<br>

Deploy the OVA as usual, and boot the VM

![x](/static/2023-09-24-asa/00a.png)

<br>
<br>

## Initial Configuration

Connect through console, and start configuring the management interface

```shell
interface Management0/0
 nameif management
 security-level 100
 ip address 198.18.0.251 255.255.255.0 
```

<br>

Create a local user

```shell
username helena password cisco privilege 15
```

<br>

Enable local user access to SSH and HTTP

```shell
aaa authentication ssh console LOCAL
aaa authentication http console LOCAL
```

<br>

Next enable all segments to access SSH and HTTP through management interface

```shell
ssh 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 management
http 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 management
```

<br>

Lastly enable HTTP service

```shell
http server enable
```

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Cisco ASDM

> Cisco ASDM (Adaptive Security Device Manager) is a GUI tool used for configuring and managing Cisco ASA firewalls 

Now open the management IP using web browser, select Install ASDM Launcher

<br>

Next just run the installer

<br>

After that just login to the management interface using the local user

![x](/static/2023-09-24-asa/03.png)

<br>

And we're in ASDM

<br>

Plus its also available on MacOS

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Interfaces

First, lets configure the outside interface

```shell
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 nameif outside
 security-level 0
 ip address 198.100.0.2 255.255.255.0 
```

<br>

Next the inside

```shell
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 nameif inside
 security-level 100
 ip address 63.0.0.1 255.255.255.0 
```

<br>

Add a static route on the outside to the internet

```shell
route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 198.100.0.1 1
```

<br>

That should do, this configuration can also be viewed on ASDM

![x](/static/2023-09-24-asa/07a.png)

<br>

And pinging the interfaces from inside and outside network shows these are up and running

<br>


## Configuring Access List Policy

Create access list to enable traffic from inside to outside and vice versa

```shell
access-list inside_access_out extended permit ip any any
access-list outside_access_in extended permit ip any any
```

<br>

Apply the access list to the respective interface

```shell
access-group inside_access_out in interface inside
access-group outside_access_in in interface outside
```

<br>

Here's how the config shown in ASDM

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Static NAT

Next configure the static NAT

```shell
object network INSIDE_HOST
 host 63.0.0.141
 nat (inside,outside) static 198.100.0.3
```

<br>

Here's the static route configuration on ASDM

<br>
<br>

## Testing Static Route

> Inside to Outside

Connecting from inside host to the internet shows a success

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-nat/01a.png)

<br>

> Outside to Inside

The web server on inisde host can be accessed using the NAT IP Address

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-nat/01.png)

<br>

ASDM also has a neat packet tracer feature to test traffic

> Inside to Outside

<br>

> Outside to Inside

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Dynamic NAT Overload

Because we already have the policy configured, we can proceed with configuring the PAT configuration

```shell
object network INSIDE_NETWORK
 subnet 63.0.0.0 255.255.255.0
 nat (inside,outside) dynamic interface
```

<br>

This is the configuration shown on ASDM

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-nat/05.png)

<br>

Now trying to connect to internet from any IP on the inside segment should be successful
