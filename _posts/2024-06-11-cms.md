## Deploying CMM

Deploy the CMM ova as usual

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/01.png)

<br>

Boot up the server then give it proper IP Addressing

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/02.png)

<br>

After some time the CMM is installed and can be accessed by web browser

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/03.png)

<br>

## Deploying CMS

Next deploy the actual CMS Server

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/04.png)

<br>

After the server boots up, login with admin and no password, and change the ip address of the "a" interface

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/05.png)

<br>
<br>

## Configuring CMM

Now access the CMM's Web UI and change the default password

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/06.png)

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/07.png)

<br>

Next on Settings >> CDR, enter the CMM's FQDN

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/08.png)

<br>

Then configure the NTP

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/09.png)

<br>

Restart the server for the changes to take effect

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/10.png)

<br>

After the server is up again, go to Settings >> Licensing, activate Smart Licensing

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/11.png)

<br>
<br>

## Installing CMS Node

Still on CMM, on Severs >> Add Server, select Configure and Add new Meeting Server

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/12.png)

<br>

Enter CMS’s IP Address and the credentials

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/13.png)

<br>

Select the desired deployment type

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/14.png)

<br>

Select certificate type, here we’ll use CA Signed and create new CSR

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/15.png)

<br>

Enter the FQDN of CMS and the SIP Domain

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/16.png)

<br>

Sign the CSR with ClientServer Certificate Template

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/17.png)

<br>

Then upload the Certificate and the CA

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/18.png)

<br>

Configure NTP, DNS and Web admin port

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/19.png)

<br>

For call bridge, point the SIP Proxy to the CUCM

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/20.png)

<br>

Next Configure the LDAP Integration

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/22.png)

<br>

Review the configuration and hit next to push the configuration

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/23.png)

<br>

After some time, the CMS is no fully up and listed as a sever on CMM

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/24.png)

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/25.png)

<br>

Lastly, activate the 90 days trial license so we can use all the features without waiting for the actual license being synced with the Smart Account

<br>
<br>

## Configuring CMS

Now the CMS management web can be accessed on port 445

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/27a.png)

<br>

### User Configuration

To retrieve users from Active Directory, go to Configuration >> Active Directory and fill in the details 

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/30.png)

<br>

And after that on Status >> Users, the AD users should show up

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/31.png)

<br>

### Meeting

Now we can login to CMS using user invoker

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/32.png)

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/33.png)

<br>

And here we can have a meeting in invoker's personal space

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/34.png)

<br>

### Meeting Space

Next lets create a new space that can be dialed for instant meetings named "mainspace" with CallID "4000"

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/35.png)

<br>

And now we can dial "4000" to enter the meeting space

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/36.png)

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/37.png)

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/38.png)

<br>

### Meeting Monitoring

Back on CMM, we can monitor the ongoinf meeting here

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/39.png)

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/40.png)

<br>

We can also see the connected user on CMS >> Status >> Calls

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/41.png)

<br>
<br>

## Integrating with CUCM

In order to directly join a meeting from CUCM Endpoints, we need to configure the CUCM integration. Firstly create a Route Pattern and a SIP Trunk pointing to CMS

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/42.png)

<br>

On CMS, catch the dialed pattern into a meeting space on "URI user part"

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/43.png)

<br>

Now if we dial 4000, we will be directed to the meeting space

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/44.png)

<br>

On CMM, we can see that this is a SIP Call Type

![x](/static/2024-06-11-cms/45.png)

<br>

Same goes on CMS Calls Status shwoing both SIP and Web meeting users
