Check Point vSNext in R82 is the modern evolution of VSX, designed to simplify virtualization of security gateways while improving scalability and management. Unlike legacy VSX, it introduces a more flexible architecture for creating and managing virtual systems, and it aligns closer to Maestro’s concept of elastic expansion—making it easier to adapt firewall capacity and resources as needed. <br>

## VSNext Installation

To enable VSNext, we need to do that on the installation wizard of the first node

<br>

After installation finishes, we will see the platform as ElasticXL with menus to manage Virtual Systems and Cluster Management

<br>

On Virtual System, by default we have the VS0 (equivalent of the VSX Gateway) and Virtual Switch 500 for the management interface

<br>

On Network Interfaces, a new warp0 interface is created to manage this VS0

## Smart Console Integration

To add the VS0 to Smart Console, we add it as if its a regular gateway object

To modify which interfaces are assigned to the VS, we can do that here

## New Virtual System

Next we add a new VS1 which we will assign 2 new interfaces and a virtual management IP Address so we can use it to integrate to Smart Console later

On Smart Console, we add the new VS like a regular gateway object

<br>

The VS names will automatically change following naming schemes from Smart Console, we can change the VS that we currently open on GAIA from the little swicth on top of the dashboard

<br>

Here we can see both VS are handling traffic with its own policy package like a regular VS

## New Cluster Member

To add new Cluster Member, just clean install the new machine and put it in the same network

![x](/static/2025-09-20-cp-vsnext/16.png)

<br>

The new machine will show up as pending gateway that we can add to the cluster

<br>

To see HA status on CLI, use the same commands as in the legacy VSX Cluster

<br>

Or we can use the new Insights dashboard from CLI as well
