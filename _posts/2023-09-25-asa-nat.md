## Configuring Access List Policy

Create access list to enable traffic from inside to outside and vice versa

```shell
access-list inside_access_out extended permit ip any any
access-list outside_access_in extended permit ip any any
```

<br>

Apply the access list to the respective interface

```shell
access-group inside_access_out in interface inside
access-group outside_access_in in interface outside
```

<br>

Here's how the config shown in ASDM

## Configuring Static NAT

Next configure the static NAT

```shell
object network INSIDE_HOST
 host 63.0.0.141
 nat (inside,outside) static 198.100.0.3
```

<br>

Here's the static route configuration on ASDM

## Testing Static Route

> Inside to Outside

Connecting from inside host to the internet shows a success

<br>

> Outside to Inside

The web server on inisde host can be accessed using the NAT IP Address

<br>

ASDM also has a neat packet tracer feature to test traffic

> Inside to Outside

> Outside to Inside

<br>

## Configuring Dynamic NAT Overload

Because we already have the policy configured, we can proceed with configuring the PAT configuration

```shell
object network INSIDE_NETWORK
 subnet 63.0.0.0 255.255.255.0
 nat (inside,outside) dynamic interface
```

<br>

This is the configuration shown on ASDM

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-nat/05.png)

<br>

Now trying to connect to internet from any IP on the inside segment should be successful
