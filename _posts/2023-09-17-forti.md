## What is Fortigate?

Fortinet FortiGate is a next-generation firewall (NGFW) that provides a comprehensive range of security services to protect networks from a wide range of threats. It combines traditional firewalling capabilities with deep packet inspection (DPI), intrusion prevention system (IPS), web filtering, and other security features to provide a holistic approach to network security.

## Preparing the Installer

First, sign up for an account on [Forti Support](https://support.fortinet.com/), then go to VM Downloads

<br>

On the downloaded files, there will be several version that we can choose, here's the mapping to suit the ESXi environment

```shell
|-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
|               Template                  |               Compatible with             |
|-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| FortiGate-VM64.ovf                      | ESXI 8.0(Hardware Version 20) or later    |
|-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| FortiGate-VM64.hw13.ovf                 | ESXI 6.5(Hardware Version 13) or later    |
|-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| FortiGate-VM64.hw15.ovf                 | ESXI 6.7U2+(Hardware Version 15) or later |
|-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| FortiGate-VM64.hw17.ovf                 | ESXI 7.0(Hardware Version 17) or later    |
|-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| FortiGate-VM64.vapp.ovf                 | ESXI 8.0(Hardware Version 20) or later    |
|-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| FortiGate-VM64.nsxt.ovf                 | ESXI 6.7U2+(Hardware Version 15) or later |
|-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| FortiGate-VM64-ZNTA.vapp.ovf            | ESXI 7.0(Hardware Version 17) or later    |
|-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
```

<br>

Deploy the ovf on ESXi as usual, then boot it.

<br>

Connect through console, the default credentials are admin with no password (blank)

![x](/static/2023-09-17-forti/04.png)

<br>

Check the IP address obtained from DHCP with "diagnose ip address list", and make sure it's able to connect to internet for license activation

<br>
<br>

## Fortigate GUI Initial Configuration

Now open the obtained IP Address on web browser

![x](/static/2023-09-17-forti/06.png)

<br>

Select evaluation license and enter the account created earlier

![x](/static/2023-09-17-forti/07.png)

<br>

After it reboots, it will enter the setup

![x](/static/2023-09-17-forti/08.png)

<br>

And the installation complete, now the FortiGate is up and running

<br>

## Configuring Network Interfaces

Got to Network >> Interfaces, change the IP following the topology

![x](/static/2023-09-17-forti/10.png)

<br>

Now that we changed the DHCP obtained IP Address with the static one, give it a default gateway on Network >> Static Route

![x](/static/2023-09-17-forti/11.png)

<br>

Now lets try accessing the Inside interface (61.0.0.1) from a linux host (61.0.0.141)

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Firewall Policy to Enable Internet Access

In order for linux host to access the internet, its IP Address needs to be translated using Forti's Outside IP Address. <br>
Go to Policy & Objects >> Firewall Policy, Create New

![x](/static/2023-09-17-forti/13.png)

<br>

Don't forget to log all sessions so we can see the traffic's report

![x](/static/2023-09-17-forti/14.png)

<br>

Now let's try simulate accessing the internet from linux host

![x](/static/2023-09-17-forti/15.png)

<br>

On Log & Report >> Forward Traffic, we can also see the traffic from linux host going to internet
