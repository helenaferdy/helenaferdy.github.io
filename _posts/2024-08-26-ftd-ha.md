Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) failover cluster, configured in Firepower Management Center (FMC), is a setup where multiple FTD devices are grouped to provide high availability and redundancy. In this configuration, one device acts as the primary, actively handling traffic, while the other(s) serve as standby units, ready to take over in case of a failure. This setup ensures continuous network security operations without interruptions, enhancing reliability and performance.

## Active-Standby

Here on FMC we have registered 2 FTD Firewalls running in standalone mode

<br>

To create a HA Cluster, select Add >> High Availability, then select the peers

![x](/static/2024-08-26-ftd-ha/02.png)

<br>

Then configure the HA & State links, which in this case we will be using the same link

<br>

And that's pretty much it, now we have the HA Cluster up and configured

Now the Primary node will actively synchronizing configuration to the Secondary node which is in standby mode, which shows below where FTD2 now has the same interface configuration as FTD1

## Failing Over

To test the failover, lets simulate a network failure by disconnecting the Primary's Uplink and Downlink interfaces

<br>

An health warning pops up informing there's an interface failure on Primary Node and the Secondary has taken the Active role

![x](/static/2024-08-26-ftd-ha/07a.png)

<br>

It shows that FTD2 now is active and FTD1 is in failed state

![x](/static/2024-08-26-ftd-ha/08.png)

<br>

We can also go to CLI and run "show failover status" to see the cluster status

![x](/static/2024-08-26-ftd-ha/08a.png)

<br>

Looking at the traffic logs, we can see the traffic is now handled by FTD2

![x](/static/2024-08-26-ftd-ha/10.png)

<br>

And there's no significant impact felt on the client side when the cluster is failing over

![x](/static/2024-08-26-ftd-ha/09.png)

<br>

On System >> Monitoring, we can see the detailed health issue thats currently going on in the cluster

<br>

## Switching Back

Now if we restore the network connectivity on FTD1, it will change the state from Failed to Standby

![x](/static/2024-08-26-ftd-ha/11.png)

![x](/static/2024-08-26-ftd-ha/12.png)

<br>

To force the FTD1 to take the active role, run command "failover active"

![x](/static/2024-08-26-ftd-ha/13.png)

<br>

And now the active role has been given back to FTD1
