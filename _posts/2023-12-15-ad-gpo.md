GPO is a set of rules or settings in a Microsoft Windows OS that administrators use to control and manage the configuration of users and computers in an Active Directory environment. GPOs enable centralized management of security policies, software installation, and other system settings across a network of computers.

<br>

## Configuring OU (Organizational Unit)

First of all, we have 3 Computers inside the HelenaComputers OU

## Using GPO for Software Installation

To create GPO, open Group Policy Management, and right click on the OU and select Create GPO

<br>

Give it a name, in this case its **Install Software** and Edit it

![x](/static/2023-12-15-gpo/03.png)

<br>

Open Policies >> Software Settings >>  Software Installation, select New >> Package

![x](/static/2023-12-15-gpo/04.png)

<br>

Select the package to be installed via GPO

<br>

That should be it for the configuration and the software should be installed on the next reboot, but oftentimes the installation doesnt succeed because the computer simply doesn't have enough time between the boot to process the GPO.
To overcome that, go to Administrative Templates >> System >> Group Policy >> Specify startup policy processing wait time

![x](/static/2023-12-15-gpo/06.png)

<br>

Enable it and give the wait time a value of 120 seconds

<br>

That should do it.

<br>
<br>

## Forcing the GPO Update

At this point, rebooting the computer should apply the GPO, but running **gpupdate /force** works too

<br>

And after a reboot, the software should be installed

<br>

running the command **gpresult /z** shows the policy's status, as seen below the Software Installation has been executed with the software details listed below that

## Using GPO to Change Wallpapers

Now let's do another usecase to change computers' wallpapers, on the same OU, create another policy named **Change Wallpaper**

![x](/static/2023-12-15-gpo/11.png)

<br>

On User Configuration >> Policies >> Administrative Templates >> Desktop, select Desktop Wallpaper

![x](/static/2023-12-15-gpo/12.png)

<br>

Enable it and select the UNC path towards the wallpaper

![x](/static/2023-12-15-gpo/13.png)

<br>

And after a reboot, the wallpaper should change
