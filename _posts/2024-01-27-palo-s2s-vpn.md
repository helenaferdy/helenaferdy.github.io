A Site-to-Site IPSec VPN is a secure connection established between two networks, connecting different offices or branches of an organization over the internet via Palo Alto firewalls.

<br>
<br>

Here's the topology of the configuration

## Configuring IPSec VPN on Palo-1 device

On the first firewall, create a new tunnel interface

<br>

Next on Network Profiles >> IKE Crypto, create a new profile

> An IKE (Internet Key Exchange) Crypto Profile is a configuration that defines the parameters and settings used for the initial phase of establishing a VPN tunnel. It includes the encryption and authentication methods to be used during the key exchange process.

Next on IPSec crypto, alo create a new profile

> An IPSec Crypto Profile is a configuration that defines the parameters and settings used for the second phase of establishing a VPN tunnel, which involves securing the data traffic between two sites. It specifies the encryption and authentication methods for protecting the actual data transmitted over the VPN tunnel.

<br>

After that, on IKE Gateways create a new gateway

> An IKE (Internet Key Exchange) Gateway is a configuration that defines the properties of a remote peer or site with which the firewall will establish a VPN tunnel. It includes information such as the remote peer's IP address, pre-shared key, and the specific IKE Crypto Profile to be used for key exchange.

<br>

Next, create the IPSec tunnel using all the profiles created earlier

> IPSec tunnel is the actual secure communication channel established between the Palo Alto and remote device, which is the other Palo Alto device.

<br>

Lastly, create a routing rule to forward the designated traffic to the tunnel interface

## Configuring IPSec VPN on Palo-2 device

On the other end device (Palo-2), we just pretty much mirror the entire configuration from the Palo-1

## Validating S2S IPSec VPN

Now on IPSec tunnel on Palo-1, we should see the IPSec tunnel being established

<br>

On the routing table, we can validate the 10.2.0.0 is forwarded to the tunnel interface

<br>

Same goes on the Palo-2

![x](/static/2024-01-27-palo-s2s-vpn/20.png)

<br>

On a pc client on Palo-1, we can confirm that the traffic is going though to Palo-2

![x](/static/2024-01-27-palo-s2s-vpn/21.png)

<br>

Same goes the vice versa

![x](/static/2024-01-27-palo-s2s-vpn/22.png)

<br>

Monitoring the traffic, we can see that the traffic is indeed going though the tunnel interface
