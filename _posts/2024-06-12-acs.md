Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) is a comprehensive network access policy solution that provides authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services. It enables organizations to centrally manage network access policies, ensuring secure and efficient access to network resources by validating user credentials and enforcing security policies.
