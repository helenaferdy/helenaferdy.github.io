Cisco ASA AnyConnect VPN integrates with Cisco ISE as a RADIUS server to authenticate remote users, where ASA forwards authentication requests to ISE, which then verifies user credentials against Active Directory or local identity source.

<br>

Here we have a working Cisco AnyConnect VPN deployment that authenticate against ASA's internal users

<br>

## ISE

To offload the authentication to ISE, first we're gonna configure a Network Device Groups named VPN

![x](/static/2025-02-20-asa-ise/02.png)

<br>

Then add the ASA as a Network Device that's part of the VPN Device Group

![x](/static/2025-02-20-asa-ise/03.png)

<br>

Then we use the VPN Grup as a condition for this new Policy Set

<br>

## ASA

Now on ASA side, add ISE as a Radius Server

![x](/static/2025-02-20-asa-ise/05.png)

<br>

Run the authentication test for good measure

![x](/static/2025-02-20-asa-ise/06.png)

<br>

Then on AnyConnect Connection Profiles, we will create a new dedicated connection profile for users authenticating to ISE

<br>

Or if we're modifying existing profile, all needs to be done is changing the AAA Server Group to from LOCAL to ISE

![x](/static/2025-02-20-asa-ise/08.png)

<br>

That should do it, now lets try connecting to VPN using ISE user to the ise_vpn connection profile / group

![x](/static/2025-02-20-asa-ise/09.png)

<br>

And we have successfully connected

<br>

On ISE, we can see the Radius Logs of the VPN user authenticating

<br>

## Adding Dynamic ACL

We can also add DACL to the VPN users connecting, giving more granular contorl on which resource are allowed. First we add a DACL on ISE

![x](/static/2025-02-20-asa-ise/12.png)

<br>

Then add the DACL to the Authorization Profile

![x](/static/2025-02-20-asa-ise/13.png)

![x](/static/2025-02-20-asa-ise/14.png)

<br>

Now when we connect, we can only access the allowed resources stated on the DACL

![x](/static/2025-02-20-asa-ise/15.png)

![x](/static/2025-02-20-asa-ise/16.png)

<br>

And the 

## Dynamically Assign Group Policy

Other than giving dynamic ACL, we can also dynamically assign Group Policy for each connecting user. First let's create a new Group Policy name ise_vpn_x thats not by default used by any Tunnel Group

![x](/static/2025-02-20-asa-ise/17.png)

<br>

This Group Policy has a different split tunnel ACL that only allow to specific hosts

![x](/static/2025-02-20-asa-ise/18.png)

<br>

Then on ISE, we can call this Group Policy on the Authz Profile

![x](/static/2025-02-20-asa-ise/19.png)

<br>

When we connect to the VPN, we get the ise_vpn_x Group Policy, we can also see we get some very specific routes because of the specific split tunnel ACL
