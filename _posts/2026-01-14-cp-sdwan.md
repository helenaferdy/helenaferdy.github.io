Check Point Quantum SD-WAN is an integrated SD-WAN solution built into Quantum gateways that provides dynamic path selection, link bonding, and application-aware traffic steering across multiple WAN links. For the deployment, it requires the Check Point Infinity service because SD-WAN orchestration, centralized policy management, real-time analytics, and path performance monitoring are delivered through the Infinity cloud platform.


## Enabling SD-WAN

Here we have Management and Gateways that's already connected to an Infinity Account, we plan to enable Quantum SD-WAN on CPSG1

<br>

First we need to enable SD-WAN on both the WAN interfaces

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/03.png)

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/04.png)

<br>

Then we go into the Quantum SD-WAN menu on Infinity Portal

<br>

We need to enable the Nano Agent on the CPSG, to do that go to profile and select the Quantum Profile

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/06.png)

<br>

Here we are given a token, copy the command including the token

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/07.png)

<br>

And run in on the CPSG1 in expert mode, it will download the necessary Nano Agent Depedencies

<br>

Once installation finishes, run "cpnano -s" to verify the service status

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/09.png)

<br>

Back on the Infinity Portal, we will see the CPSG1 being listed in the Agents menu

<br>

## Setting Up SD-WAN

Now back to the Get Started page, hit Open Wizard and select our management server

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/11.png)

<br>

On Use Cases, this menu will generate predefined SD-WAN Policies, so lets select the default internet ones

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/12.png)

<br>

On Gateways, select our CPSG1

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/13.png)

<br>

Then map the WAN Interfaces 

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/14.png)

<br>

That should do it, hit done

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/15.png)

<br>

## SD-WAN Policy

By default we are given these policies, lets remove them all and create from scratch

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/16.png)

<br>

First we will create a Steering Policy, a steering policy defines how traffic is dynamically directed across available WAN links. The first one we will create a "Load Balance" policy

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/17.png)

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/18.png)

<br>

Next one is "Best Quality" steering policy, where it will dynamically select the best WAN link

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/19.png)

<br>

And last one is "Manual" steering policy, where we will prioritize WAN 2 as the main link

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/20.png)

<br>

And we create 3 SD-WAN policies that use those 3 steering policies each

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/21.png)

<br>

Once the changes are Published and Enforced, we can verify this on CPSG1 by running "cpview"

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/22.png)

<br>

Now on the client side, we will try accessing internet through our CPSG1 firewall

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/23.png)

<br>

On the Monitor Logs, we can see that the Load Balance policy is being used and both WAN Links are used to access internet

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/24.png)

<br>

## Link Swap

Now lets simulate a link failure by disabling the WAN 1

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/25.png)

<br>

On the Dashboards we get immediate notification to see that WAN 1 is down

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/26.png)

<br>

And on the logs, we can observe that it automatically steers traffic to only use the available WAN link

![x](/static/2026-01-14-cp-sdwan/27.png)

<br>

Infinity Portal also has a decent dashboard to see the overall SD-WAN performance
