Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise (PCCE) is a comprehensive contact center solution designed for large organizations. It integrates various communication channels (like voice, email, chat, and social media) into a unified system, allowing businesses to manage customer interactions efficiently.

<br>

## Preparing Installation

Here we will install PCCE 12.6(2) Lab Simplex Mode, which it consists of these following servers :
> * AW-HDS-DDS : Manages system configuration and stores detailed and historical call data for reporting.
> * PG (Peripheral Gateway): Connects and manages communication between the contact center and peripheral devices.
> * Rogger (Router and Logger): Routes calls and logs call routing data for real-time and historical reporting.
> * CVP (Customer Voice Portal): Provides IVR capabilities for customer interactions before agent routing.
> * CUCM : Manages IP telephony and VoIP call routing and features.
> * CUIC : Generates comprehensive reports and dashboards from contact center data.
> * Finesse : Web-based interface for agents and supervisors to manage calls and access customer information.
> * VVB : Interfaces between IVR applications and the telephony network for voice interactions.

<br>

The first 4 servers are Windows Based, follow this [PCCE 12.6.2 Intstallation Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cust_contact/contact_center/pcce/pcce_12_6_2/installation/guide/pcce_b_1262_cisco_pcce_installationandupgrade_guide/pcce_b_cisco_pcce_installationandupgrade_guide_12_5_2_appendix_01010.html) for setting up the Windows Servers up to the Database installation.

## Preparing Windows Based Servers

> AW, PG, Rogger

For these 3 servers, run the ICM 12.5.1 Installer

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/01.png)

<br>

Select Fresh Install

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/02.png)

<br>

For Maintenance Release, point it to the 12.6(2) Patch Installer

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/03.png)

<br>

Select the disk target

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/04.png)

<br>

Lastly hit Install

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/05.png)

<br>

After the installation finishes, the server will restart and the 12.6(2) Installer would show up

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/07.png)

<br>

Hit next until the it asks for another restart

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/08.png)

<br>

The ICM installation finishes

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/09.png)

<br>

> CVP

For CVP, run the CVP 12.5(1) Installer, select CVP Server

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/10.png)

<br>

Select the desired codec

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/11.png)

<br>

Then select the installation paths

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/12.png)

<br>

Next hit install

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/14.png)

<br>

Restart the server, then continue running the 12.6(2) Installer

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/15a.png)

<br>

Restart the server for the second time, and the CVP installation is done

<br>
<br>

## Preparing Linux Cisco Appliances

Install all the linux servers

> CUCM

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/15z.png)

<br>

> CUIC

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/16.png)

<br>

> Finesse

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/17.png)

<br>
<br>

## Running the Domain Manager

On AW, open Domain Manager and add the Cisco Root, Facility, and Instance names

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/18.png)

<br>
<br>

## Dealing with Certificates

Before we proceed with PCCE installations, we have to make sure all the servers trust each other's web certificates

> AW, PG & Rogger

Open Keystore Explorer and point it to C:\icm\ssl\cacerts, then import all certs and CA

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/22.png)

<br>

Do the same for the cacerts for the OpenJDK

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/23.png)

<br>

> CVP

Import all the certs using the keytool command

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/24.png)

<br>
<br>


## Installing PCCE

To begin the PCCE installation, open the CCE Admin web page

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/19.png)

<br>

Configure the Deployment Type and select the Instance

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/20.png)

<br>

Next enter the Inventory containing the server details

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/21.png)

<br>

Here's what the csv filled with

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/21a.png)

<br>

Next select the audio codec and enter the admin credential, then hit next

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/25.png)

<br>

Let the installation runs

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/26.png)

<br>

After awhile, SPOG CCE Admin should be accessible

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/27.png)

<br>
<br>

## Adding VVB

Next install the VVB Server

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/28.png)

<br>

Access the VVB Admin page and run the components activation

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/29.png)

<br>

After that, select Add External Machine and add the VVB

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/32.png)

<br>

Now we have all the servers installed

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/33.png)

<br>
<br>

## Configuring CUCM

Firstly, configure Clusterwide Domain Configuration

> To route calls to agents, PCCE uses a SIP server group requiring an FQDN format. Although this is a fabricated FQDN, it must be configured in CUCM, otherwise CUCM will reject the calls.

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/35.png)

<br>

Next create a SIP Trunk pointing to the CVP server

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/34.png)

<br>

After that, we want to configure so CUCM is able to send calls to PCCE (also known as CUCM PG originated calls). This number will be triggered when we make an internal call through CTI Route Point. <br>
To actually know the number, go to Overview >> Call Settings >> Miscellaneous >> Main Site, and look at the Unified CM Label

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/36.png)

<br>

Now add create a Route Pattern pointing to CVP based on that label followed by 4 extra digits (XXXX), which is a correlation ID that PCCE prepends by default.

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/37.png)

<br>
<br>

## Configuring PCCE Route Settings

Next We are going to create two types of routes in PCCE. One for our network VRU labels and another for our Agent Extensions. <br>
Firstly, on Route Settings >> SIP Server Groups, create Server Groups for our VVB and for our CUCM

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/38.png)

<br>

Then on Route Pattern, we're creating pattern that starts with 70XX because that's our agents extensions, then we add the 77777777> pattern which is the default Network VRU label, and lastly we also add routes for 91919191 and 92929292 for default ringtones and error messages

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/39.png)

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Voice Gateway

On the VG, we're creating a dial-peer to pass the call to CVP with the dialed pattern of 6000

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/40.png)

<br>

And now if we try making a call to 6000 that goes though VG, we can see on Router Log Viewer that the call has been received by PCCE

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/41.png)

<br>
<br>

## Configuring PCCE 

Now is where we actually configure PCCE to handle a call, on CCE Admin >> Overview >> Route Settings, add new Call Type

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/42.png)

<br>

Next create a new Dialed Number of 6000 pointing to the Call Type, with the routig type of External because this is an external call received from VG

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/43.png)

<br>

Then create a new simple ICM Script to handle a call and pass it to a VXML Application. This application only plays a simple music

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/44.png)

<br>

After that, associate the Script to the Call Type

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/45.png)

<br>

Now trying to make another call going to 6000, the call is handled by PCCE as shown by the Script Monitor

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/46.png)

<br>
<br>

## Passing Call to Agents

Now we change the Script a little bit, where after the music ends we will pass the call to a skill group with an agent ready to answer the call

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/47.png)

<br>

Now when we make another call to 6000, it'll be passed to an agent

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/48.png)

<br>
<br>

## Creating Internal Calls from CUCM to CVP

To create an internal call, add a new Dialed Number pointing to the same Call Type, but with the routing type of Internal Voice

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/49.png)

<br>

On CUCM, create a CTI Route Point with the same Extension registered to the pguser

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/50.png)

<br>

And if we make an internal call to 6100, the call will be passed to CVP

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/51.png)

<br>

And eventually to the same agents because we use the same Call Type and Script

![x](/static/2024-05-14-pcce/52.png)
