On ASDM, go to Configuration >> Device Management >> Identity Certificates

<br>

Fill in the details, and select Generate Request

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-vpn/93.png)

<br>

Then we get the CSR, copy the text and hit save

## Configuring Anyconnect Remote Access VPN Wizard

<br>

Give the connection profile a name and select the outside interface

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-vpn/04.png)

<br>

Select SSL Protocol and use the certificate created earlier

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-vpn/05.png)

<br>

For client images, use the package uploaded earlier

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-vpn/06.png)

<br>

Select local users and create the users that will connect to the VPN

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-vpn/07.png)

<br>

Next create a pool of IP Address for the VPN clients

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-vpn/08.png)

<br>

Provide the DNS Server for the VPN clients

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-vpn/09.png)

<br>

Exempt the VPN traffic from NAT translations and select the inside subnet as the network that can be accessed by the VPN clients

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-vpn/10.png)

<br>

Review the summary and click finish

## Configuring Anyconnect Client Profile

On Configuration >> Remote Access VPN >> Anyconnect Client Profile, add new. <br>
Give it a name and select the VPN Group Policy generated by the wizard

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-vpn/11a.png)

<br>

Select the profile and click edit, On VPN Establishment select AllowRemoteUsers

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-vpn/11b.png)

<br>

Thats pretty much it on the ASDM side. Save the configuration

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Split Tunnel Access List

Last one, on CLI, create an access-list containing the inside segment that should be advertised to the VPN clients

```shell
access-list SPLIT_TUNNEL standard permit 63.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 
```

<br>

Apply the access-list on the group policy attributes

```shell
group-policy GroupPolicy_helena_vpn attributes
 split-tunnel-policy tunnelspecified 
 split-tunnel-network-list value SPLIT_TUNNEL
```

<br>

That should wraps everything up

<br>
<br>

## Connecting to VPN form the Client

On the client PC, access the FQDN / IP Address of the VPN Gateway, and login with the local user

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-vpn/12.png)

<br>

The page to download the anyconnect client should show up. Click download and install the package

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-vpn/13.png)

<br>

Run the client, fill in the VPN gateway

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-vpn/14.png)

<br>

Select the group and input the local user

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-vpn/15.png)

<br>

And we are connected. We're able to ping the inside network, and on statistics we can see the details of the VPN connection

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-vpn/16.png)

<br>

On Route Details, we can also see the advertised network that was set on the SPLIT_TUNNEL access-list

![x](/static/2023-09-25-asa-vpn/16a.png)

<br>

Going back to ASDM, on Monitor >> VPN >> Sessions, we can see the currently connected VPN clients
