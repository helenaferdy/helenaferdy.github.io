Zabbix is an open-source monitoring tool designed to track the performance and availability of IT infrastructure, including servers, network devices, and applications. It uses protocols like SNMP to gather real-time data, enabling efficient monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting of network devices and other systems.

## Installing Zabbix

Download Zabbix Appliance on its official website, here we're selecting the VMWare (vmwx) version

![x](/static/2024-12-28-zabbix/01.png)

<br>

Next upload the .vmdk & .vmx files into the datastore

![x](/static/2024-12-28-zabbix/02.png)

<br>

Then select the .vmx file and hit "Register VM"

![x](/static/2024-12-28-zabbix/03.png)

<br>

Now we can start register the Zabbix VM

<br>

After that we can now access Zabbix CLI with credentials root/zabbix

## Configuring Static IP Address

By default Zabbix will get IP Address from DHCP Server, to change it into static ip, edit the interface file on "/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0"

![x](/static/2024-12-28-zabbix/09.png)

<br>

Then restart the networking service by "systemctl restart network", run "ip a s eth0" to see the current IP Address, and add default route to the gateway

<br>
 
Lastly configure the DNS Server on "/etc/resolv.conf"

![x](/static/2024-12-28-zabbix/11.png)

<br>

Make sure we can ping an FQDN on internet, and run "dnf upgrade" to upgrade our zabbix installation

![x](/static/2024-12-28-zabbix/12.png)

<br>

After all that, now we should be able to access our Zabbix Server on port 80

## Adding SNMPv2c Host

To add a new host, go to Monitoring >> Hosts >> Create Host

![x](/static/2024-12-28-zabbix/15.png)

<br>

On the network device side, we configure the SNMPv2c so Zabbix can start polling in data

![x](/static/2024-12-28-zabbix/15a.png)

<br>

For good measure, run "snmpwalk -v2c -c helena 198.18.128.10 1.3.6.1.2.1.1" on a linux server to make sure the network device is accepting SNMP requests

![x](/static/2024-12-28-zabbix/15b.png)

> 1.3.6.1.2.1.1 is an Object Identifier (OID) that represents the system group defined in the MIB-2 standard. This group provides general information about the device being monitored, such as its description, uptime, contact information, and name.

<br>

And we can see Zabbix is now polling in SNMP data from the core switch

## Adding SNMPv3 Host

Next we'll add another host but this time using SNMPv3

![x](/static/2024-12-28-zabbix/19.png)

<br>

On the XE1, we configure the SNMPv3 accordingly

![x](/static/2024-12-28-zabbix/20.png)

<br>

Running "snmpwalk -v 3 -u helena -a md5 -A helena123 -x des -X helena123 -l authPriv 198.18.133.121 1.3.6.1.2.1.1" confirms that the router is accepting snmp requests

![x](/static/2024-12-28-zabbix/20a.png)

<br>

And now the XE1 is also up and running on Zabbix
