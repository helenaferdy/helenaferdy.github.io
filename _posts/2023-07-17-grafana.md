## What is Grafana?

Grafana is a data visualization and analytics tool that integrates with Prometheus to create rich, interactive dashboards and visualizations. <br>
Grafana is a great companion for Prometheus as it's able to take the data that Prometheus has collected and present it in a visually appealing dashboards.

<br>

## Setting up Grafana

<br>

First, add Grafana repository to our linux server

```shell
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common wget
wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list
```

<br>

Now we can begin the installation

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install grafana -y
```

<br>

After that, we can just start the Grafana service

```shell
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
```

<br>

Use this commmand to check wether the service is up and running

```shell
systemctl status grafana-server
```

```
● grafana-server.service - Grafana instance
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/grafana-server.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Mon 2023-07-17 05:32:36 UTC; 6h ago
       Docs: http://docs.grafana.org
   Main PID: 3984 (grafana)
      Tasks: 15 (limit: 9386)
     Memory: 77.2M
        CPU: 51.622s
     CGroup: /system.slice/grafana-server.service
             └─3984 /usr/share/grafana/bin/grafana server --config=/etc/grafana/grafana.ini --pidfile=/run/grafana/grafana-server.pid
```

<br>

Now we can access the web on http://198.18.0.120:3000

<br>

## Connecting to Prometheus

<br>

To connect it with Prometheus, we need to add Prometheus as a Data Source on Grafana.
To do that, go to **Administration > Data Sources > Prometheus**, and then add the url to the Prometheus server.

<br>

After that, you can start creating cool dashboards utilizing data scraped by Prometheus

<br>
<br>

## Using Dashboard Templates

<br>

Creating your own dashboard is pretty cool, but its confusing and tideous,
a better way to do that is utilizing pre-exisiting dashboard that you can easily import.
Here you can find a lot of cool [Grafana Dashboards](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/)

<br>

Here we'll use the [Node Exporter Full](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/1860-node-exporter-full/). This dashboard will show metrics scraped by Node Exporter module.
Select **Copy ID to Clipboard**

<br>

After that paste the ID that has been copied

<br>

And now we have a clean dashboard for our nodes.

<br>
<br>

Another dashboard example, this time its for SNMP Exporter called [SNMP Device Summary](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12489-snmp-device-summary/).
This is how it looks like
