## What is SNMP Exporter?
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) Exporter is a tool that allows you to export metrics from devices that support SNMP. SNMP Exporter collects data from SNMP-enabled devices such as routers, switches, servers, and network appliances. 

## What is Node Exporter?
Node Exporter is a Prometheus exporter specifically designed to collect metrics from Linux and Unix-like systems. It provides detailed information about the system's hardware and operating system, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk utilization, network statistics, and more.

## Topology
![01](/static/2023-07-17-snmp-node/01.png)

As you see above, we'll have 3 nodes to be collected its data to Prometheus, where 2 of them are Cisco Routers and 1 of them is an Ubuntu server.

<br>

## Setting up SNMP Exporter

For the Cisco Routers, we'll utilize the SNMP Exporter to collect its data.
SNMP Exporter will be installed on main Prometheus server and it'll periodically scrapes data to the target hosts.

First, download the [SNMP Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter/releases), and then extract it.

```shell
wget https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter/releases/download/v0.23.0-rc.0/snmp_exporter-0.23.0-rc.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvzf snmp_exporter-0.23.0-rc.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

<br>

And then copy the files to its respective directories

```shell
cd snmp_exporter-0.23.0-rc.0.linux-amd64
sudo cp snmp_exporter snmp.yml /usr/local/bin/
```

<br>

Then create the snmp-exporter service file

```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/snmp-exporter.service
```

<br>

And this to the file

```
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus SNMP Exporter Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=prometheus
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/snmp_exporter --config.file="/usr/local/bin/snmp.yml"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

<br>

After that we start the service

```shell
systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start snmp-exporter
sudo systemctl enable snmp-exporter
```

<br>

Check the service status with this command

```bash
systemctl status snmp-exporter
```

```
● snmp-exporter.service - Prometheus SNMP Exporter Service

```

<br>

Validate the installation by visiting via browser http://<ip-address:9116>

<br>

Next we add the SNMP Exporter into the Prometheus configuration file

```shell
sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

<br>

Add this at the bottom of the line, you should change the targets IP according to your environment. You should also try playing around with the auth and SNMP module.

```yml
  - job_name: 'snmp'
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - 198.18.0.121 
        - 198.18.0.122 #your network device
    metrics_path: /snmp
    params:
      auth: [public_v2]
      module: [if_mib]
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: 127.0.0.1:9116
```

<br>

Run this command to make sure your Prometheus config file is syntactically correct

```shell
promtool check config /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

```
Checking /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
 SUCCESS: /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml is valid prometheus config file syntax
```

<br>

If all is good, we can proceed to restart Prometheus service.

```shell
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
```

<br>

Now your SNMP Devices should show up on your Premetheus Targets page.

## Setting up Node Exporter

Unlike SNMP Exporter, We'll be installing Node Exporter directly on the target host. Node Exporter exposes metrics about the system's hardware and operating system through an HTTP endpoint.

<br>

First, let's create a service user for it

```shell
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false nodeuser
```

<br>

Then we create a directory for Node Exporter's configuration, along giving it the right owner.

```shell
sudo mkdir /etc/node_exporter
sudo chown -R nodeuser:nodeuser /etc/node_exporter
```

<br>

Then we'll download the [Node Exporter](https://prometheus.io/download/#node_exporter) and extract it.

```shell
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.6.0/node_exporter-1.6.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar node_exporter-1.6.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

<br>

Next we copy the file to its appropriate directory and give it a correct owner

```shell
cd node_exporter-1.6.0.linux-amd64/
sudo cp node_exporter /usr/local/bin/
sudo chown -R nodeuser:nodeuser /usr/local/bin/node_exporter
```

<br>

After that we create a service file

```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service
```

<br>

and paste this into the file

```
[Unit]
Description=Node Exporter Service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=nodeuser
Group=nodeuser
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

<br>

Then, we start the service by running the following commands

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start node_exporter
sudo systemctl enable node_exporter
```

<br>

Check the status of the service by running this

```shell
systemctl status node_exporter
```

```
helena@ubuntu2:~$ systemctl status node_exporter
● node_exporter.service - Node Exporter Service
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Mon 2023-07-17 03:18:21 UTC; 7h ago
   Main PID: 17759 (node_exporter)
      Tasks: 5 (limit: 4557)
     Memory: 8.7M
        CPU: 1min 45.941s
     CGroup: /system.slice/node_exporter.service
             └─17759 /usr/local/bin/node_exporter
```

<br>
<br>

Now we jump back to the Prometheus server, and add Node Exporter to the config

```shell
sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

<br>

And paste this at the bottom of the line. Make sure to change the targets IP according to your environment.

```yml
  - job_name: 'node_exporter_client'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    scheme: http
    basic_auth:
      username: prom
      password: prom
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['198.18.0.220:9100']
```

<br>

Run this command to make sure the config file is in a correct format

```shell
promtool check config /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

<br>

And if it's all good, restart the Prometheus service.

```shell
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
```

<br>


Now you should be able to see your Node Exporter target host on Prometheus.

Next, we'll use Grafana to visualize this data into a visually appealing dashboard.
