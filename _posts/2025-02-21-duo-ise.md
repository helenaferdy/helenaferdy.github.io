Cisco Duo integrates with Cisco ISE to enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for network access. The integration involves configuring Cisco ISE as a RADIUS client for Duo's Authentication Proxy, which acts as an intermediary between ISE and Duo's cloud service. When a user attempts to authenticate, ISE forwards the authentication request to the Duo Authentication Proxy, which validates the primary credentials to Active Directory. If successful, Duo triggers a second-factor authentication to the user. Upon successful MFA, ISE grants network access based on the configured policies.

## Duo Admin Portal

Everything configured here is continuing from this [Cisco Duo and ASA AnyConnect Integration](https://helenaferdy.github.io/posts/duo-asa/) post, here on the Cisco Duo Admin Portal we make sure that the user is present

<br>

Then we add another Application to protect named "Cisco ISE Radius"

Take notes of the configuration values provided here

<br>

And paste it below the ASA configuration, hit save and restart the service

## ISE

On Cisco ISE, we add a new External Identity Source of RADIUS Token

<br>

Then add the source into an Identity Source Sequences

<br>

Now we can use this sequence on the Authentication Profile within the RADIUS Policy Set

<br>

When we hit the Policy Set rule, we will get a MFA confirmation on the Cisco Duo Mobile App

<br>

On the Radius Live Logs Details, we can see that the ISE uses the Duo Proxy as the Identity Source for Authentication

<br>

Other than for Network Access, we can also use Duo for Device Admin (TACACS), here we use the Identity Source on the Authentication of a TACACS Policy Set

<br>

When we try to access the network device, we'll get a MFA cofirmation on the App

<br>

The TACACS Live Logs shows that we're authenticating against a Duo Proxy Identity Source
