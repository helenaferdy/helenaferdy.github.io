## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a popular static site generator that allows you to build and deploy static websites easily. It was designed to simplify the process of creating simple, fast, and secure websites. Jekyll is built using Ruby and uses the Liquid template language.

Jekyll has a lot of templates that you can use as a base configuration for your website, for this very website that i created, i use [Chripy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).


## How to install and host on Github

Access the [Chirpy Starter Github Page](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter), select *Use This Template* and *Create new repository*.

If you want your website to be accessible with the url of your github account (eg. helenaferdy.github.io), you have to give it a specific name (username.github.io) like shown down below.
Mine is already used so it throws error but yours should be good.

Now we enable github page so the website is hosted on github and accessible on the internet.
Access your github repository, go to *Settings >> Pages* and select the branch to be hosted.

```

To push it to your github repo, simply run these commands
```shell
git add .
git coommit -m "your comments"
git push
```


## Add posts

To add posts, create a new file inside the *_posts* directory.
Format the name of your file like this *yyyy-mm-dd-name.md*

And then you can just write anything you please there.
make sure to always have this lines on top of your file as it is used by jekyll as a metadata for your posts.
