## What is NAT & Destination NAT?

NAT (network address translation) is a method that allows devices on a local network to share a single public IP address for accessing resources on the internet.
Destination NAT (DNAT) specifically focuses on modifying the destination IP address of incoming packets to redirect incoming network traffic to a different destination IP address or port number within the local network.

## Configuring NAT

### Configuring Security Policy

On Policies >> Security, create new

![x](/static/2023-09-21-palo-nat/01.png)

> Give it a name

![x](/static/2023-09-21-palo-nat/02.png)

> Set the source to be the Inside Zone

![x](/static/2023-09-21-palo-nat/03.png)

> Set the service to be any

<br>

### Configuring NAT Policy

On Policies >> NAT, create new

> Give it a name

![x](/static/2023-09-21-palo-nat/05.png)

> Set the source to be the Inside Zone and destination to be the Outside Zone

> Configure the translation type to dynamic ip and port, with the IP Address used is the outside interface

<br>

### Testing the NAT Configuration

Now on the host in the inside network, we should be able to access the internet

<br>

On Monitor >> Traffic, we should see the traffic going from inside to the internet

<br>

On Monitor >> Session Browser, we can see the Policy used as well as the detail of the traffic and its response

## Configuring Destination NAT

### D-NAT Topology

### Configuring NAT Policy

On Policies >> NAT, create new

![x](/static/2023-09-21-palo-nat/10.png)

> Give it a name

![x](/static/2023-09-21-palo-nat/11.png)

> Set both the source and destination zone to be outside, and the destination address to be the Public NAT IP

![x](/static/2023-09-21-palo-nat/12.png)

> Set the translated address to be the host's IP on the inside network

<br>

### Configuring Security Policy

On Policies >> Security, create new

![x](/static/2023-09-21-palo-nat/13.png)

> Give it a name

![x](/static/2023-09-21-palo-nat/14.png)

> Set the source to be the Outside Zone

![x](/static/2023-09-21-palo-nat/15.png)

> Set the destination to be the Inside Zone, but the address is is the NAT Public IP

![x](/static/2023-09-21-palo-nat/16.png)

> Set the service to be any

<br>

### Testing the D-NAT Configuration

Now the Public NAT IP should be accessible from internet

And looking at the Traffic Monitor, we can also see the traffic coming from outside to the NAT IP
