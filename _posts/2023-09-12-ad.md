## What is Active Directory Domain Services?

Active Directory Domain Services is a Microsoft Windows server-based directory service that manages and stores information about network resources and facilitates the organization and management of users, computers, and other network objects within a network.

Give it a password

<br>

The wizard might shows that it cannot create DNS delegation. That's fine we'll deal with it later

<br>

Give it a NETBIOS name

## Configuring DNS

Open DNS Manager, make sure the helena.com zone is present

![x](/static/2023-09-12-ad/11.png)

<br>

On Reverse Lookup Zone, right click and add new, select Primary Zone

<br>

Add the subnet of the network. If there are more than one, just repeat the process

![x](/static/2023-09-12-ad/14.png)

<br>

Or we can just use a very broad subnet of 198, meaning it will cover all subnets on with 198.x.x.x

## Joining other PC to the Domain

Song long the DNS is pointed to the domain controller, we can now join the domain from other PC in the network, which is XS2 here.

<br>

On Computers list on helena.com, we can see XS2 is now listed

![x](/static/2023-09-12-ad/17.png)

<br>

And it is also resolvable on the domain search of helena.com
