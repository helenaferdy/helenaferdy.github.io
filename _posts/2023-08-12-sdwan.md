## Whats Cisco SD-WAN?

Cisco SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network) is a technology that enables organizations to optimize and manage their wide area network connections more efficiently. It uses software-defined networking principles to dynamically route and prioritize network traffic, making it easier to connect and manage various branch offices, data centers, and cloud services.
<br>
SD-WAN helps improve network performance, reduce costs, and enhance security by intelligently directing traffic over different connection types, such as MPLS, Metro-ethernet, or Internet, based on application and network conditions.

<br>
<br>

## Deployment Topology

<br>

This is the overall topology for this SD-WAN Deployment, where there will be vManage, vBond and vSmart as the central controllers, and there will be 2 Edge Routers with 3 WAN Networks.

* **vManage**: vManage is the centralized management and orchestration platform for Cisco SD-WAN. It provides a graphical interface for configuring, monitoring, and troubleshooting the SD-WAN network. 
* **vSmart**: vSmart controllers are responsible for making intelligent routing decisions within the SD-WAN network. They use policies and real-time network conditions to determine the optimal path for application traffic to take through the network.
* **vBond**: vBond acts as the orchestrator for the initial setup and authentication of SD-WAN devices. It establishes secure connections between SD-WAN edge routers and the rest of the SD-WAN components.

## Preparing the Installation

<br>

First, download the OVA installers on Cisco's Website

<br>

After that deploy it just like a regular OVA file.

<br>

And then access the VMs through console, the default credentials are admin/admin.

<br>
<br>

## Initial Configuration

<br>

Now we will configure VPN0 and VPN512 interface on these, VPN0 handles control plane communication between SD-WAN components, while VPN512 facilitates data plane communication between different VRFs within the SD-WAN architecture.

<br>

> **1. vManage**

```shell
config terminal

system
system-ip 1.1.1.1
site-id 1
organization-name helena
vbond 10.0.0.12
exit

vpn 512
 interface eth1
  ip address 198.18.0.211/24
  no shutdown
  exit

 ip route 0.0.0.0/0 198.18.0.1
 exit
commit

vpn 0 
 interface eth0
 ip address 10.0.0.11/24
 no shutdown
 tunnel-interface
  allow-service all
  allow-service netconf
  exit
 exit
ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.0.0.1
commit and-quit
```

<br>

> **2. vBond**

```shell
config terminal

system
 host-name vbond
 system-ip 1.1.1.2
 site-id 1
 organization-name helena
 vbond 10.0.0.12 local
 exit
commit

vpn 0 
 interface ge0/0
  ip address 10.0.0.12/24
  no shutdown 
  tunnel-interface
   allow-service all
   allow-service netconf
   exit
  exit
 ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.0.0.1 
 exit
commit

vpn 512
 interface eth0
  ip address 198.18.0.212/24
  no shutdown
  exit
 ip route 0.0.0.0/0 198.18.0.1
commit and-quit
```

<br>

> **3. vSmart**


```shell
config terminal

system
 system-ip 1.1.1.3
 site-id 1
 organization-name helena
 vbond 10.0.0.12
 exit
commit

vpn 0 
 interface eth0
  ip add 10.0.0.13/24
  no shut
  tunnel-interface
   allow-service all
   allow-service netconf
   exit
  exit

 ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.0.0.1
 exit
commit

vpn 512
 interface eth1
  ip address 198.18.0.213/24
  no shutdown
  exit

 ip route 0.0.0.0/0 198.18.0.1
 commit and-quit
```

<br>
<br>

Now the vManage's Web UI should be accessible through its VPN512's IP Address, open it on web browser

![x](/static/2023-08-12-sdwan/05.png)

<br>

Go to Administration >> Settings, fill out the organization name and vbond's IP Address

![x](/static/2023-08-12-sdwan/06.png)

<br>

Then on Controller Certificate Authorization, we'll use Enterprise because we happen to manage our own CA (Certificate Authority) server

![x](/static/2023-08-12-sdwan/07.png)

<br>
<br>

## Adding Controllers to vManage

<br>

Now we'll onboard both vBond and vSmart to become our controllers, go to Configuration >> Devices >> Controllers

![x](/static/2023-08-12-sdwan/08.png)

<br>

Choose Add Controller >> vBond, fill out vBond's IP Address and credentials

![x](/static/2023-08-12-sdwan/09.png)

<br>

Same goes with vSmart

![x](/static/2023-08-12-sdwan/10.png)

<br>
<br>


## Signing Controller's Certificate

<br>

After all controllers are onboarded, now we sign their certificates. <br>
Go to Configuration >> Certificates >> Controllers, <br>
And then just view the CSR and Sign in on the CA Server.

![x](/static/2023-08-12-sdwan/11.png)

<br>
 
 After signing the CSR, install the certificate

![x](/static/2023-08-12-sdwan/12.png)

<br>

Repeat for the rest, the we end up with this

![x](/static/2023-08-12-sdwan/13.png)

<br>

And on vManage Dashboard, we should see the vBond and vSmart are recognized
