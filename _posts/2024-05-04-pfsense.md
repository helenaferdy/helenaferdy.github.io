## Allowing Management Access on WAN Interface

By default we are only allowed to access the firewall on the LAN interface, to enable the WAN access add a WAN firewall rule to enable the traffic

## Configuring Internet Access for Clients

First, on Firewall >> NAT >> Outbound, create a NAT rule for our LAN network

<br>

Next create a LAN Firewall Rule to allow traffic coming from 10.0.0.0/24

<br>

That'll do it, now the clients should have internet access through pfSense Firewall

<br>

On Status >> System Logs >> Firewall, we can see the clients traffic flowing through the Internet Access Rule
