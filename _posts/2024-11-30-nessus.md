Tenable Nessus is a vulnerability assessment tool that scans IT systems to identify security weaknesses, misconfigurations, and compliance issues. It helps organizations proactively manage and mitigate risks by providing detailed reports and remediation guidance.

## Nessus Installation

Download the Nessus Installer on its official website and choose the appropirate operating system, then run the installer.

<br>

After that, Nessus should be accessible on port 8834

<br>

Start the trial registration if you dont have the license

<br>

After that we can now create the administrator user account to access Nessus

<br>

And now Nessus is up and running

## Host Discovery

On Scanner list, lets try running the Host Discovery

![x](/static/2024-11-30-nessus/08.png)

<br>

We'll call it "host_discover" and set it to scan the 198.18.128.0/18 network

![x](/static/2024-11-30-nessus/09.png)

<br>

After around 4 minutes of scanning, it has found 27 hosts in my private network

![x](/static/2024-11-30-nessus/10.png)

![x](/static/2024-11-30-nessus/11.png)

<br>

It also runs a simple vulnerability assessment towards the discovered hosts

<br>

## Credentials Scan

Now lets try a more advanced scan under "Basic Network Scan", here we'll once again scan the 198.18.128.0/18 network

![x](/static/2024-11-30-nessus/13.png)

<br>

But the difference is now we'll provide the credentials for Nessus to be able to login to the discovered hosts, here we give it credentials for SSH and RDP

![x](/static/2024-11-30-nessus/14.png)

<br>

And after running for over an hour, Nessus has successfully logged in to 4 hosts and ran a lot of vulnerability assessments

![x](/static/2024-11-30-nessus/15.png)

<br>

Here we can see the VA results per scanned host

![x](/static/2024-11-30-nessus/16.png)

<br>

Here's the detailed VA result of the 198.18.128.2 host, which is my domain controller in this network

![x](/static/2024-11-30-nessus/17.png)

<br>

We can also sort the results by the VA scans

![x](/static/2024-11-30-nessus/18.png)

<br>

And taking a closer look to the found vulnerability

![x](/static/2024-11-30-nessus/19.png)

<br>

On top of that, Nessus also gives us a remediation recommendation for the vulnerabilities found

## Exporting Scan

The scan that was run on Nessus can easily be exported to be used as a VA report
