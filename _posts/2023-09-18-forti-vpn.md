## What is IPSec Remote Access VPN?

An IPSec Remote Access VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a secure network connection that allows remote users or devices to access a private network over the internet using the IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) protocol suite. It provides encryption, authentication, and secure communication, allowing remote users to securely connect to a corporate or private network from a remote location.

## Connection Topology

Here's the connection topology, where PC on the internet will become the VPN client to connect to the inside network

## Configuring VPN User

On Fortigate, go to User & Authentication >> User Definition, create new, choose local user

![x](/static/2023-09-18-forti-vpn/02.png)

<br>

Give it username and password

<br>

Leave 2FA off

<br>

Enable user

<br>

Now go to User & Authentication >> User Groups, create new, include the new user as a member

## Configuring Remote Access VPN

Go to VPN >> IPsec Wizard, select the type of Remote Access and the client of Forticlient

<br>

On Authentication, select the WAN interface as the incoming interface, the auth method as pre-shared key, and add the user group created earlier

<br>

On Policy & Routing, select the LAN interface as the local interface, select the local address that will be accessible from VPN, and give the VPN Users the IP Address range

<br>

On Client Options, leave it as it is is fine

<br>

Lastly, review and create

<br>

Now the VPN is set up

<br>

On Firewall Policy, we'll see new policy automatically generated

## Connecting VPN from Client PC

On this client PC, we have a connection to the Forti's WAN IP but not the inside segment

![x](/static/2023-09-18-forti-vpn/14.png)

<br>

Configure the connection as below

![x](/static/2023-09-18-forti-vpn/15.png)

<br>

Because we're using an evaluation license, we have to set the IKE Proposal to use weak encryption configuration as below

> IKE (Internet Key Exchange) is a protocol used in IPsec VPNs to establish a secure connection between two devices, such as a computer and a network gateway, by negotiating encryption and authentication keys. <be>
> * Encryption : DES uses a 56-bit key and is considered weak by today's standards, while AES-128 uses a 128-bit key and is considered a strong and secure encryption algorithm. <br>
> * Authentication : MD5 and SHA1 is no longer secure for cryptographic use due to vulnerabilities to collision attacks, while SHA-256 is a highly secure cryptographic hash function with a 256-bit output, resistant to collision attacks. <br>

<br>

Now try to connect

![x](/static/2023-09-18-forti-vpn/16.png)

<br>

And we're connected. We're able to access the Inside segment

![x](/static/2023-09-18-forti-vpn/17.png)

<br>

On Dashboard >> IPsec Monitor, we can see the connected VPN client

![x](/static/2023-09-18-forti-vpn/18.png)

<br>

And on Log & Report >> Forward Traffic, we can see all the traffic flowing from the VPN client
