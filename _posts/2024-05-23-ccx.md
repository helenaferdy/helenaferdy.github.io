Cisco Contact Center Express (UCCX) is a comprehensive customer interaction management solution designed for small to medium-sized businesses. It provides a robust, easy-to-deploy platform that integrates seamlessly with Cisco Unified Communications Manager, offering a range of features such as multichannel routing, advanced call handling, IVR (Interactive Voice Response), and real-time and historical reporting. 

<br>

## Installing CCX

Deploy the OVA file and run the installer

<br>

After it finishes, access the Web UI

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/03.png)

<br>

Configure the AXL integration to CUCM

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/04.png)

> * AXL (Administrative XML) integration allows CCX to interface with CUCM to perform administrative tasks programmatically. 
> * AXL leverages SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) over HTTPS to enable operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving information about CUCM objects, including users, devices, and configuration settings.

<br>

Next select the licensing scheme

<br>

Next confirm the licsensing details, here we will also get a 90 day evaluation period

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/06.png)

<br>

After that it'll start the components activation sequence

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/08.png)

<br>

Next select the AXL provider, since we only have one CUCM so just select the one available

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/09.png)

<br>

Configure the JTAPI and RMCM integration to CUCM

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/10.png)

> * JTAPI (Java Telephony API) is a Java-based interface allows CCX to interact with the call processing capabilities of CUCM.
> * RMCM (Resource Manager Contact Manager) manages the allocation and availability of contact center resources, such as agents and queues. It handles tasks like agent login/logout, skill-based routing, and real-time monitoring of agent status and performance.

<br>

Next configure the outbound seats, this refer to the licenses required for agents to participate in outbound dialing campaigns.

<br>

Then select the default language for prompts audio

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/12.png)

<br>

After that, select one End User on CUCM configured as the CCX Administrator

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/13.png)

<br>

The installation sequense is finished, the server should automatically reboots

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/14.png)

<br>
<br>

## Configuring IVR and CUCM Integration

### CTI Ports

After the server rebooted, we should be able to access the CCX main menu

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/15.png)

<br>

On Subsystem >> Cisco Unified CM Telephony >> Call Control Group, create CTI Ports used later by the CCX IVR Applications

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/16.png)

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/17.png)

<br>

This will create CTI Port Devices on CUCM

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/18.png)

<br>

### Resources

To create resources (agents), on CUCM End Users, add the the Primary and IPCC extension to that particular user

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/19.png)

<br>

Then on the RMCM Appliaction User, add the user's phone as the controlled device

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/19a.png)

<br>

Now on Subsystem >> RmCM >> Resources, that user should show up

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/20.png)

<br>

To see the rest of CUCM users, even the one not registered as resource, and also their roles on CCX, go to Tools >> User Management >> User View

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/21.png)

<br>

### Resource Groups & Skills

Next on Subsystem >> RmCM >> Resource Groups, create a new group to contain the resources made just now

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/22.png)

<br>

Then on Subsystem >> RmCM >> Skills, create new Skill to be assigned to the resources

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/23.png)

<br>

Now back to the Resources, select the user and assign the Resource Group and the Skill

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/24.png)

<br>

### Contact Service Queue (CSQ)

Next on Subsystem >> RmCM >> Contact Service Queue, create a new CSQ used to manage and route incoming customer calls to the appropriate agents based on their skills

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/25.png)

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/26.png)

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/27.png)

<br>

### CCX Application (IVR)

Next to actually have an IVR to handle calls, go to Application >> Application Management, create a new App using the template script available

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/28.png)

<br>

Then add the trigger number

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/29.png)

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/30.png)

<br>

Over at CUCM, a new CTI Route Point will be created with the same extension number

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/31.png)

<br>

## Making a Call

Login to Finesse using the registered resource on https://ccx:8445/desktop/

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/32.png)

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/33.png)

<br>

Now if make a call to 2001, it will route the call to the CSQ that assigns the call to this user

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/34.png)

<br>

## CUIC Reporting

Access CUIC on https://ccx:8444/cuicui/

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/34a.png)

<br>

To see the report of agent's call activities, open Agent Detail Report

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/35.png)

<br>

To see agent's aux activities, open Agent State Detail Report

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/36.png)

<br>

To see the number of calls received by agents as well as with abandoned calls that was not picked by agents, open Agent All Fields Report

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/37.png)

<br>

To drill more on the abandones calls, open Abandoned Call Detail Activity Report

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/37a.png)

<br>

To see the reports grouped by the skills, open Common Skill CSQ Activity Report

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/38.png)

<br>

To actually see all the calls received by CCX, open Detailed Call CSQ Agent Report

![x](/static/2024-05-23-ccx/39.png)

> * The first call with * meaning it's handled by that particular CSQ and picked up by an agent
> * The second row shows the call is abandoned on queue without getting to agent
> * The last row shows that the call is abandoned while ringing on agent wihout being picked up
