Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) Single Sign-On (SSO) is a feature that enables users to log in once and access multiple applications and services within the CUCM environment without the need for repeated authentication. This is achieved by integrating CUCM with an identity provider supporting standard protocols like SAML or LDAP.

<br>

## Exporting Metadata Trust on CUCM

On CUCM, go to System >> SAML SSO, select export

<br>

We'll get an XML agreement file

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Relying Party Trust on ADFS

On the Windows ADFS, select Add Relying Party Trust

> Relying party trust is a configuration that establishes a trust relationship between the ADFS server (the identity provider) and a relying party, which is the CUCM.

<br>

Select Claims Aware

> In a claims-aware system, the identity provider (IDP) includes additional information about the user, known as claims, in the authentication token or assertion, whereas In a non-claims-aware system, the authentication token or assertion typically contains only the information necessary for basic authentication.

<br>

Select the exported xml file from cucm

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/05.png)

<br>

Give it a display name

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/06.png)

<br>

For access control, just permit everyone for the sake of simplicity

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/07.png)

<br>

Finish it up and close the window

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/08.png)

<br>

On the edit claim window, select Add Rule and select "Send LDAP Claims as Attributes"

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/08a.png)

<br>

Give it a name and map the SAM-Account-Name to uid

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/08b.png)

<br>

Next add another rule, this time select "Send Claims using a Custom Rule"

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/08c.png)

<br>

Give it a name and paste this custom rule

```text
c:[Type == "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname"]
=> issue(Type = "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier", Issuer = c.Issuer, OriginalIssuer = c.OriginalIssuer, Value = c.Value, ValueType = c.ValueType,Properties["http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claimproperties/format"] = "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient",Properties["http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claimproperties/namequalifier"] = "http://ad.helena.gg/com/adfs/service/trust", Properties["http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claimproperties/spnamequalifier"] = "cucm.helena.gg");
```

<br>
<br>

## Configuring SSO on CUCM

Back on CUCM, select enable SAML SSO

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/09.png)

<br>

Make sure everthing is green and select next

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/10.png)

<br>

Next download the IdP Metadata Trust on https://ad.helena.gg/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/11.png)

<br>

Select the Federation Metadata and select Import

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/12.png)

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/13.png)

<br>

Next we can skip this part because we have done it earlier

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/14.png)

<br>

Next select one AD User used to test the SSO functionality

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/15.png)

<br>

The SSO Login Page should pop up

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/16.png)

<br>

The test has succeeded!

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/17.png)

<br>

And the SSO is now enabled on CUCM

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/18.png)

<br>
<br>

## Login Test on MacOS

On MacOS the test should be pretty straight forward, just open Jabber and the SSO Login Page should pop up

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/19.png)

<br>

And we have successfully logged in

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/20.png)

<br>
<br>

## Login Test on Windows

On windows, on the ADFS Server we have to enable Kerberos authentication by registering Service Principal Names (SPNs) for services running on an ADFS server. 

```console
setspn -a HTTP/ad.helena.gg helena\helena
```

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/21a.png)

<br>

Next we need to make sure to enable all browser/application agents to ADFS's Windows Integrated Authentication (WIA).

Run this command to check the enabled agents
> Get-AdfsProperties | Select WIASupportedUserAgents -ExpandProperty WIASupportedUserAgents

and this one to enable it on all agents
> Set-AdfsProperties -WIASupportedUserAgents @("MSIE 6.0", "MSIE 7.0; Windows NT", "MSIE 8.0", "MSIE 9.0", "MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6", "Windows NT 6.3; Trident/7.0", "Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64; Trident/7.0", "Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; Trident/7.0", "Windows NT 6.2; Trident/7.0", "Windows NT 6.2; Win64; x64; Trident/7.0", "Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; Trident/7.0", "Windows NT 6.1; Trident/7.0", "Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/7.0", "Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0", "MSIPC", "Windows Rights Management Client")

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/22.png)

<br>

Now on the client side, we also need to whitelist the ADFS Server on the Internet Properties of every client trying to authenticate

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/23.png)

<br>

Next on security settings, we can configure the behaviour of the SSO Sign In, this configuration will always ask for a credentials

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/24.png)

<br>

But this one will automatically log the user in if that user has been authenticated

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/25.png)

<br>

Now that we've successfully logged in, on the client's pc we can run "klist" to see the kerberos tickets used for SSO Authentication

![x](/static/2024-01-13-cucm-sso/27.png)

<br>

Furthermore on the ADFS Server, we can see the Event Viewer audit for every user that authenticates on the ADFS server
