Calabrio One is a recording platform designed to capture and store various customer interactions, including phone calls, as part of its broader workforce optimization suite. This functionality allows businesses to monitor and analyze these interactions for quality assurance, compliance, and performance evaluation purposes.

## Preparing the Installation Environments

Here's the overall topology for this installation

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/00.png)

<br>

First we're gonna do most of our works on server "cbr", which is the Platform Core. <br> 
Here the SQL Server 2022 has been installed

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/01.png)

<br>

Next create 3 directories that has been shared over SMB

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/02.png)

<br>
<br>

## Installing Calabrio ONE

After prep is done, run the Calabrio ONE installer

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/03.png)

<br>

Pick a directory for the installation

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/04.png)

<br>

Select full installation

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/05.png)

<br>

For the configuration path, use one of the directory created earlier

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/06.png)

<br>

Wrap it up and select install

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/07.png)

<br>

After a while, we should see the Calabrio services are installed and running

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/08.png)

<br>

Next put the ffmpeg files on App server and Grid directories

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/09.png)

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/10.png)

<br>

After that install the ODBC Driver so we can connect to our SQL Server

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/10a.png)

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Calabrio ONE

Now we should be able to hit cbr's localhost on the web browser to open the Calabrio ONE Configuraton page. <br>
Enter the details and select the license, then hit Save.

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/11.png)

<br>

And now Calabrio ONE is up and running

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/12.png)

<br>

First let's configure the storage location where the recording will be stored, select Media and point it to the Media Directory

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/13.png)

<br>

Then create another one for the Network Directory

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/14.png)

<br>

Next create a tenant, give it a name and a good password as those will be used to create a new Database on the server for that specific tenant

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/15.png)

<br>

Give it an admin user for login purposes

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/16.png)

<br>

Select the storage location and hit save. This will take some time to finish

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/17.png)

<br>

After it finishes, the new database is created for that tenant

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/18.png)

<br>

Lastly allocate the license for the newly created tenant

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/19.png)

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Tenant

Now login to Calabrio ONE using the tenant's admin user

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/20.png)

<br>

We'll be taken to the tenant's calabrio one instead

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/21.png)

<br>

As a good practice, lets create CSR for the web server's SSL Certificate

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/22.png)

<br>

Sign the CSR and put the cert and the key on the server config directory

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/23.png)

<br>

Edit the httpd.conf file and point the configuration to the new certificate and key

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/24.png)

<br>

While we're at it, also edit these urls to point to cbr's IP Address

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/25.png)

<br>

Restart the web service

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/26.png)

<br>

The certificate has been updated and now trusted

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/27.png)

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Signal Capture & Data Server

On the cbrsig server, create a new directory for the temporary audio file to be stored while the recording is taking process

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/28.png)

<br>

Next open the calabrio one and download the Data Server installer

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/29.png)

<br>

Run the installer on cbrsig

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/30.png)

<br>

Now the services should be installed and running

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/31.png)

<br>

Looking back at calabrio one, we can see the Data Server status is connected

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/32.png)

<br>

Next download the JTAPI Client from CUCM

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/33.png)

<br>

Copy it to the lib folder on the data server

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/34.png)

<br>

Restart the CTI Signaling Service

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/35.png)

<br>

Back on calabrio one, configure the data server to point to the cbrsig's IP Address and hit save

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/36.png)

<br>

Next on Telephony Groups, create a new group for CUCM

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/37.png)

<br>

configure the AXL and JTAPI connection to CUCM

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/38.png)

> * AXL is a web service interface that allows external applications to communicate with and manage the configuration of Cisco Unified Communications Manager. It enables automation of administrative tasks such as creating, updating, and deleting objects like phones, users, and devices in the CUCM database.
> * JTAPI is a Java-based API used for developing telephony applications that integrate with Cisco Unified Communications Manager. It allows developers to create applications that can control and monitor telephony devices, such as phones and gateways, within the CUCM environment.
> <br>
> * In general, AXL is used for provisioning new phones/users while JTAPI is used for call control or monitoring.

<br>

Add the IP Address of the CUCM

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/39.png)

<br>

On siganling, select the IP Address of cbrsig and cucm

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/40.png)

<br>

Finally on recording, select the IP Address of cbrsig as our primary recorder, and hit save

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/41.png)

<br>
<br>

## Validating Configuration

Now our SIP Trunk from CUCM to the Signal Capture should be up and in Full Service

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/41a.png)

<br>

And on Telephony Monitoring, the same connection can also be observed from the calabrio's side

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/42.png)

<br>

On Device Associations, all the devices on CUCM should show up here on calabrio. <br>
Associate the device with a user and recording group for the recording to take place

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/43.png)

<br>

Also associate the recording profile to the user's phone

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/44.png)

<br>

And now if we run a network sniffer on the cbrsig, we can see the SIP and RTP traffic coming to calabrio to be recorded

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/45.png)

<br>

And on recording page, we can see the recorded calls are all listed here

![x](/static/2024-01-15-calabrio/46.png)
