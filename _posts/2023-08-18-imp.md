## What is Cisco Unified IM & Presence?

Cisco Unified Presence (CUP), now called Cisco IM&P, is a communication tool that shows real-time availability of colleagues (presence awareness) and enables instant messaging within organizations. It integrates with other Cisco tools and allows users to see who's online, busy, or away, facilitating better communication decisions.

<br>
<br>

## Preparing the Installation

First, download the OVA and ISO installer for IM&P from [Cisco Software Download](https://software.cisco.com/download/)

<br>

Then convert the non bootable ISO to become bootable, which we already covered when [Deploying CUCM](https://helenaferdy.github.io/posts/cucm/)

<br>

After that, just deploy the OVA like usual

<br>

And also create DNS Record for the IMP on the DNS Server

![x](/static/2023-08-18-imp/04.png)

<br>

Lastly, go to CUCM >> System >> Server >> Add New >> Choose IM & Presence, and add the new IMP Server

<br>
<br>

## Running the Installation

Power On the IM&P, then access it through console. Breeze through the wizards as most of it we just need to click next. 
<br>

On DHCP Configuration, choose not to use DHCP.

<br>

Give it network configuration

![x](/static/2023-08-16-cucm/06.png)

<br>

Next enable DNS Client, and input the DNS Server and the Search Domain

![x](/static/2023-08-16-cucm/07.png)

<br>

Then select No so the installation should proceed after the network tests complete

![x](/static/2023-08-16-cucm/08.png)

<br>

Then add the details about the CUCM

![x](/static/2023-08-16-cucm/09.png)

<br>

And when configuration completes, click Ok and let the installation begins

<br>

After some time, the IMP web UI should be up, open it and go to Cisco Unified IM and Presence Serviceabilty >> Tools >> Service Activation, check the services and hit save.

<br>
<br>

## Configuring IM&P on CUCM

Go to User Management >> User Settings >> UC Service >> Add new, Select the type of "CTI"

![x](/static/2023-08-16-cucm/11.png)

<br>

Save, then add another one with the type of "Im and Presence"

![x](/static/2023-08-16-cucm/12.png)

<br>

Now bundle those 2 UC Services in a Service Profile, go to User Management >> User Settings >> Service Profile >> Add new

![x](/static/2023-08-16-cucm/13.png)

![x](/static/2023-08-16-cucm/13a.png)

<br>

Next bind the Service Profile to the End User, go to User Management >> End Users, select the user, then assign the Service Profile 

![x](/static/2023-08-16-cucm/14.png)

<br>

The assigned users will show up on CUCM >> User Management >> Assign Presence Users

![x](/static/2023-08-16-cucm/14a.png)

<br>

Or we can also view it on IMP >> System >> Presence Topology

<br>
<br>


## Logging in to Jabber

Now we can try logging in with the server configuration pointed to either CUCM or IMP

![x](/static/2023-08-16-cucm/15.png)

<br>

And now we have presence and instant chat functionality

<br>
<br>


## Configuring DNS SRV

DNS SRV (Domain Name System Service Record) is a type of DNS record used to specify the host and port of services within a domain. DNS SRV records are used to facilitate the discovery of the CUCM and IM&P servers. <br>
Without SRV, we have to manually input the address of the CUCM or IM&P servers, but with it this process will be automated.

<br>

Go to the DNS Manager >> Add Other new records >> Service Location (SRV), create the first one for CUCM

> Cisco UDS (User Data Services) is a component and protocol used in CUCM deployments to provide a standardized way to access user-related data and services. UDS enables applications and devices within a CUCM environment to retrieve information about users, their profiles, capabilities, and features.

<br>

And another one for IMP

![x](/static/2023-08-16-cucm/18.png)

<br>

Run nslookup to validate the SRV are working and pointing to the FQDN of CUCM and IMP on port 8443

![x](/static/2023-08-16-cucm/19.png)

<br>

And now we're able to login straight away without configuring server addresses

![x](/static/2023-08-16-cucm/20.png)

<br>

Pressing CTRL + Shift + D will open the diagnostics page, where we can see the jabber is able to discover both the UDS and Presence server through the SRV Records
